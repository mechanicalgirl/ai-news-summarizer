## https://gmpy.dev/blog/2026/event-driven-process-waiting

This article discusses ending a 15-year reliance on inefficient "busy-loop polling" for process management in Python. Since Python 3.3, both the standard library's `subprocess` module and the `psutil` library have used a polling approach that repeatedly checks if a process has terminated by sleeping briefly, then checking again with increasing intervals. This method wastes CPU cycles through constant wake-ups, introduces latency between actual termination and detection, and scales poorly when monitoring multiple processes.

The author, Giampaolo Rodola, implemented an event-driven solution using system-specific APIs that allow the kernel to notify when a process terminates, eliminating busy-waiting. On Linux (5.3+), this uses `pidfd_open()` with `poll()`; on macOS/BSD, it uses `kqueue()`; Windows already had efficient waiting via `WaitForSingleObject`. The new approach reduces context switches from 258 to just 2 in testing, as processes now block efficiently until notified by the kernel. After implementing this in psutil, Rodola successfully contributed the improvement to CPython's standard library `subprocess` module, marking the second time in psutil's 17-year history that a feature was upstreamed to Python's standard library.

## https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/building-bits-ai-sre

Datadog has built Bits AI SRE, an AI agent that automatically investigates production incidents by mimicking how human Site Reliability Engineers work. Rather than simply summarizing telemetry data, the agent forms hypotheses about root causes, tests them using live data queries, and follows evidence until it reaches a conclusion—producing audit-ready root cause analyses in minutes. The company reports that teams using the tool have decreased incident resolution time by up to 95%.

The agent is built on a unique advantage: Datadog's extensive dataset of real production incidents, which they use to benchmark and continuously improve performance. Unlike basic summarization tools, Bits AI SRE conducts deep investigations of complex, multi-component issues by focusing on causal relationships rather than noise, performing iterative analysis similar to how a team of engineers would tackle an on-call investigation in dynamic, distributed systems.

## https://fly.io/blog/code-and-let-live

This article from Fly.io announces "Sprites," a new type of cloud compute instance that challenges the ephemeral, stateless sandbox model currently dominant in cloud computing and AI agent development. Sprites are durable Linux environments that boot in 1-2 seconds, automatically sleep when idle to save costs, support instant checkpointing and restoration, and persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted. The author argues this represents a fundamental shift away from disposable containers toward "actual computers" with persistent storage.

The key thesis is that AI agents like Claude don't benefit from stateless containers—they need durable environments where installed dependencies, files, and state persist between tasks. The current approach forces agents to waste time rebuilding environments, requires complex workarounds like external databases for persistence, and imposes artificial time limits. The author envisions a future where software development fundamentally changes, with applications living permanently in development-production hybrid environments that evolve through conversational edits with AI agents, rather than traditional deployment pipelines—exemplified by his personal MDM system that runs indefinitely on a Sprite.

# Agent Skills Summary

**Agent Skills** are modular, reusable capabilities that extend Claude's functionality by packaging instructions, code, and resources into filesystem-based directories. Unlike one-off prompts, Skills are loaded automatically when relevant to a task, eliminating the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across conversations. They enable users to specialize Claude for domain-specific tasks, reduce repetition, and compose multiple capabilities into complex workflows. Anthropic provides pre-built Skills for common document tasks (PowerPoint, Excel, Word, PDF), and users can create custom Skills to package organizational knowledge.

Skills leverage a **progressive disclosure architecture** with three loading levels: (1) metadata (always loaded, ~100 tokens) that helps Claude discover when to use a Skill, (2) main instructions from SKILL.md (loaded when triggered, under 5k tokens), and (3) additional resources and executable scripts (loaded only as needed). This filesystem-based approach allows Claude to access content on-demand via bash commands in its VM environment, meaning bundled files don't consume context tokens until actually used. Scripts run without loading their code into context—only their output appears—making Skills highly efficient and scalable with virtually unlimited bundled content capacity.

## https://afontofuseless.info/proposal-for-tls

This presentation argues that the current internet TLS certificate management system is fundamentally broken and beyond repair. The speaker traces the problem back to Netscape's 1995 design, which relies on a small group of Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are automatically trusted by browsers and operating systems to issue certificates for any domain on the internet. This system has numerous flaws: CAs make mistakes, can be compromised by bad actors, have no inherent limitations on their scope, and the revocation mechanisms (CRLs, OCSP) are all inadequate. Currently, systems trust 100-250 CAs chosen by the CA/Browser Forum, a group the speaker characterizes as an exclusive club of commercial interests.

The speaker advocates for completely abandoning the current system ("burn it down") rather than continuing to apply incremental fixes to a "tottering pile of Jenga bricks." While not proposing a specific solution, they suggest any replacement must eliminate the concept of ultimate trust for any CA chosen by a small cabal, provide immediate mechanisms for detrusting rogue CAs without waiting for OS/browser updates, and potentially abandon in-band identity verification based on pre-trusted authorities altogether. The speaker references alternative proposals like TACK and DANE that were never widely implemented, and warns that without serious action, the industry will likely continue ignoring the problem until a catastrophic security event occurs.

## https://alexgaynor.net/2025/mar/06/things-have-reasons

This article examines the tension between two conflicting principles: Chesterton's Fence (understanding why something exists before changing it) and Grace Hopper's warning against "we've always done it this way" thinking. While both seem like common sense, they appear contradictory—one favoring status quo bias and the other opposing it.

The author argues the resolution is to actively investigate the *reasons* behind current practices rather than simply deferring to tradition or rushing to change things. Often, when you actually research why a "fence" was built, you discover the reasons are historical, outdated, or no longer relevant (like a fence built for a neighbor's dog that moved away 15 years ago). The key is to gather evidence about past motivations, evaluate their current validity, and make informed decisions—avoiding both the trap of changing things from ignorance and the mistake of assuming past decision-makers had perfect, eternal wisdom. If forced to choose a bias, the author recommends leaning anti-status quo since organizations naturally favor keeping things the same.

## https://virginia-eubanks.com/automating-inequality

# Summary

Virginia Eubanks' *Automating Inequality* examines how automated systems and data analytics disproportionately target poor and working-class Americans through invasive surveillance and punitive decision-making. The book investigates how algorithms now determine which neighborhoods receive police attention, which families access social services, and who gets investigated for fraud, essentially creating a "digital poorhouse" that manages and punishes the economically vulnerable.

Through extensively researched case studies—including stories of people losing benefits while dying or families living in fear due to statistical profiling—Eubanks reveals how technology amplifies rather than solves inequality. The book argues that while everyone lives under data-driven governance, the poor face the harshest consequences, and it challenges the myth that automated systems are neutral or efficient substitutes for justice.

## https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/nicar-llms

This article summarizes Simon Willison's NICAR 2025 presentation reviewing major developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) from ChatGPT's November 2022 launch through early 2025. While 2023 was relatively quiet after GPT-4's release, 2024 saw explosive progress: GPT-4-class models became commoditized with 18 labs achieving similar capabilities, multimodal models became highly effective at processing images/audio/video, API costs dropped dramatically (though unevenly), and locally-run models on consumer laptops reached genuinely useful performance levels comparable to earlier GPT-4.

The article highlights 2025's key trends including Chinese models (DeepSeek, Qwen) making significant impacts, "inference time compute" or reasoning models that "think" before answering, and LLMs becoming highly capable at generating code and complete web applications. For data journalists specifically, Willison emphasizes that vision-based LLMs are approaching practical solutions for extracting data from PDFs, models like Gemini and Claude can process PDFs directly with improving accuracy, and journalists need to develop their own evaluation methods to assess whether models work reliably for their specific use cases like OCR on police reports or extracting structured data from documents.

## Summary

**QPen** is a Qt for Python class that defines how lines and shape outlines are drawn using QPainter. It provides comprehensive control over pen properties including style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), width (integer or floating-point precision), brush (for filling strokes), cap style (how line ends are drawn), and join style (how connected lines meet). The class offers numerous getter and setter methods to configure these properties, with defaults being a solid black brush, 1-pixel width, square cap style, and bevel join style.

The documentation details three main styling aspects: **Pen Style** (various built-in patterns like SolidLine, DashLine, or custom dash patterns), **Cap Style** (SquareCap, FlatCap, or RoundCap for line endpoints), and **Join Style** (BevelJoin, MiterJoin, or RoundJoin for line connections). Special features include cosmetic pens that maintain constant width regardless of painter transformations, and miter limit control for MiterJoin styles to reduce artifacts when lines are nearly parallel.

## https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2020/jan/06/copyleft-equality

This article by Bradley M. Kühn discusses how copyleft licenses, originally designed to protect software freedom by ensuring users receive source code and modifications, have been corrupted through "proprietary relicensing" business models. Companies using this approach maintain complete copyright control of their codebase, offer it under strong copyleft licenses like Affero GPL as a free product, then use aggressive and often exaggerated enforcement tactics to pressure commercial users into purchasing proprietary licenses for the same software out of fear of license violations.

The author argues this business model is toxic to the software freedom movement because it transforms copyleft from a tool for ensuring user rights into a weapon for vendor profit. Rather than creating communities bound together by shared freedom-ensuring licenses, proprietary relicensing creates an atmosphere of fear where users dread enforcement actions from vendors who offer no remedies beyond purchasing proprietary licenses. The article particularly criticizes companies like MongoDB for using Affero GPL this way, noting that major corporations blacklisted the license specifically due to these shake-down tactics.

## https://dan.langille.org/2025/04/17/using-ssh-authorized-keys-to-decide-what-the-incoming-connection-can-do

This article explains how to use SSH's `authorized_keys` file to control what commands incoming SSH connections can execute on a FreeBSD system. The author demonstrates restricting rsync backup operations by specifying the `command=` option in `authorized_keys`, which forces incoming connections to run only predetermined commands like `rrsync` (restricted rsync) with read-only access to specific directories, even when using passphraseless SSH keys.

The author encountered a problem when trying to set up bidirectional backups between two hosts using the same SSH key—only one command entry would match and execute. The solution was to create separate SSH key pairs for different tasks, allowing each key to be associated with its own specific command in the `authorized_keys` file. This approach maintains security on the backup server by ensuring each SSH key can only perform its designated operation.

## https://dev.to/kiwibreaksme/what-i-learned-from-steve-yegges-gas-town-and-a-small-tool-for-solo-developers-2me2

This article discusses the author's key takeaway from Steve Yegge's Gas Town project and introduces their own alternative tool. Gas Town is a multi-agent orchestration system that addresses AI coding assistants' biggest problem: context loss between sessions. It uses Git as persistent storage, employs a "Mayor" AI to coordinate 20-30 simultaneous agents, and maintains work state through "hooks" in Git worktrees—treating AI agents as ephemeral while keeping work context permanent.

Inspired by Gas Town's approach but recognizing it's designed for large teams, the author created CodeSyncer for solo developers. Instead of Git-based storage, CodeSyncer embeds context directly in code comments using special tags (`@codesyncer-decision`, `@codesyncer-inference`, etc.) that explain why code was written a certain way. This allows AI assistants to instantly recover context by reading the code itself in new sessions. Both tools share the same philosophy—"AI is ephemeral, but context should be permanent"—but target different use cases: Gas Town for enterprise teams running many agents, CodeSyncer for individual developers working with a single AI assistant.

## https://simonw.substack.com/p/first-impressions-of-claude-cowork

**Article Summary:**

Anthropic has launched Claude Cowork, a "general agent" that extends Claude Code's capabilities beyond developers to general users. Currently available only to Max subscribers ($100-200/month) through the macOS Claude Desktop app, Cowork provides an accessible interface for automating computer tasks through a sandboxed filesystem environment. The tool can perform complex operations like analyzing draft files, searching websites, and generating artifacts, though it works similarly to Claude Code with less technical packaging.

The main concern highlighted is prompt injection security risks—the possibility that malicious instructions hidden in content Claude encounters could compromise user data. While Anthropic has built defenses and runs Cowork in a sandbox by default, they acknowledge agent safety remains an active development area. The author notes this represents a significant signal for the future of AI agents, predicting competitors like Gemini and OpenAI will follow suit, while emphasizing that the prompt injection threat remains difficult to communicate effectively to non-technical users.

## https://simonw.substack.com/p/fastrender-a-browser-built-by-thousands

**FastRender Overview:**
FastRender is an experimental web browser built from scratch by Cursor using thousands of parallel AI agents working autonomously. Started as engineer Wilson Lin's personal project in November to test frontier models like Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.1/5.2, it evolved into official Cursor research. At peak operation, approximately 2,000 agents ran concurrently across large machines (about 300 agents per machine), generating thousands of commits per hour and totaling nearly 30,000 commits. The browser can currently render pages like GitHub, Wikipedia, and CNN, though JavaScript is still under development.

**Key Innovation:**
The breakthrough enabling massive parallelization was using planning agents to divide work into non-overlapping chunks, minimizing merge conflicts despite thousands of concurrent contributors. The system ran autonomously for up to a week without human intervention, relying on feedback loops including web specifications (via git submodules), visual screenshots fed to vision-capable models, and Rust's strict compiler. Interestingly, agents made their own architectural decisions—including selecting dependencies like Skia and Taffy, disabling incomplete JavaScript features, and even pulling in QuickJS as a temporary workaround while other agents built a permanent JavaScript engine. The goal was never to compete with Chrome but to research multi-agent collaboration at scale.

## https://blog.cloudflare.com/cname-a-record-order-dns-standards

This article describes a DNS resolution incident at Cloudflare on January 8, 2026, caused by a seemingly minor code optimization. While attempting to reduce memory usage in their 1.1.1.1 resolver, engineers changed how DNS records were ordered in responses, causing CNAME records to appear after A/AAAA records instead of before them. This reordering broke DNS resolution for some clients, including Linux systems using glibc's getaddrinfo function and certain Cisco switches, which expected CNAME records to appear first and processed responses sequentially.

The root cause traces back to ambiguous language in RFC 1034, the 40-year-old DNS protocol specification written before modern standards for normative requirements existed. While the RFC states that answers should be "possibly preface[d]" by CNAME records, it lacks clear "MUST" or "SHOULD" requirements and doesn't explicitly specify ordering rules for different record types within message sections. Most modern DNS clients handle records in any order by parsing them into sets first, but some legacy implementations that process records sequentially failed when the order changed. Cloudflare reverted the change within hours once the issue was identified.

## https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getaddrinfo.3.html

The `getaddrinfo()` function is a network programming interface that translates hostnames and service names into socket address structures that can be used with network functions like `bind()` and `connect()`. It combines and modernizes the functionality of older functions like `gethostbyname()` and `getservbyname()`, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses while being thread-safe (reentrant). The function takes a node (hostname or IP address), a service (port number or service name), optional hints to filter results, and returns a linked list of `addrinfo` structures containing socket addresses matching the criteria.

The function uses the `hints` parameter to specify criteria such as address family (IPv4/IPv6), socket type (stream/datagram), protocol, and various flags that control behavior. Key flags include `AI_PASSIVE` (for server applications binding to wildcard addresses), `AI_CANONNAME` (to retrieve the canonical hostname), `AI_NUMERICHOST` (to avoid DNS lookups), and `AI_ADDRCONFIG` (to return only address types configured on the system). Memory allocated by `getaddrinfo()` must be freed using `freeaddrinfo()`, and the companion function `gai_strerror()` converts error codes to human-readable strings.

## https://medium.com/freely-sharing-the-sum-of-all-knowledge/wikipedias-value-in-the-age-of-generative-ai-b19fec06bbee

Wikimedia Foundation CTO Selena Deckelmann argues that generative AI cannot replace Wikipedia because Wikipedia's value comes from its human-created, collaboratively refined, and transparently sourced knowledge—not just its content. While LLMs are trained heavily on Wikipedia data, they have critical limitations: they can't fact-check themselves (leading to fabricated citations and poor medical diagnoses), they're limited to their training data (missing non-digitized books and non-English content), and they suffer from "model collapse" when trained on AI-generated content, meaning they need fresh human-created material to remain functional.

Deckelmann outlines three principles for responsible LLM development: sustainability (supporting rather than replacing human knowledge creation), equity (addressing bias and knowledge gaps), and transparency (allowing users to verify and correct outputs). She emphasizes that Wikipedia has been using machine learning tools for over a decade, but always with human editors in control of reviewing and governing AI-generated content.

The piece concludes that human contributions remain essential to the internet's knowledge ecosystem. While generative AI could attempt to replicate Wikipedia, it would miss what makes Wikipedia valuable: the collaborative human process of creating, debating, and curating trustworthy information. For LLMs to remain effective long-term, they must prioritize human participation rather than treat it as an afterthought.

The key insight: LLMs need humans more than humans need LLMs.

Without fresh human-created content:

- LLMs get worse over time (model collapse)
- They can't fact-check themselves
- They hallucinate more
- They miss new knowledge/events

Meanwhile, humans can still:

- Create original knowledge
- Verify and refine information
- Collaborate and debate
- Build trust through transparency

The best outcomes come from humans + AI working together, with humans in control. Which is exactly how Wikimedia approaches it - AI tools support human editors, but humans make the final calls.

This philosophy probably explains why they reached out to you so fast. Your background is perfect for this: you understand infrastructure AND data, you've worked with both human teams and automation, and you clearly value the human element (all that teaching/mentoring you've done).
