## https://blog.comma.ai/datacenter/

Comma.ai has been running its own $5 million data center for years to handle model training, metrics, and data storage, avoiding cloud providers to maintain control over their destiny and costs. The company estimates they would have spent over $25 million using cloud services for the same compute needs. Their approach also encourages better engineering practices by forcing engineers to optimize code and fix fundamental issues rather than simply requesting larger budgets for more cloud resources.

Their data center operates on about 450kW of power in San Diego, using 600 GPUs across 75 in-house built TinyBox Pro machines and approximately 4PB of SSD storage, all maintained by just a couple of engineers. The setup uses outside air cooling to save power, custom distributed storage (minikeyvalue), Slurm for workload management, PyTorch for distributed training, and their own lightweight task scheduler called miniray. This infrastructure allows them to train complex on-policy driving models efficiently while keeping everything in-house and under their direct control.

## https://www.recall.ai/blog/postgres-postmaster-does-not-scale

This article details how Recall.ai, a company that records millions of meetings weekly, discovered a critical scaling bottleneck in PostgreSQL's postmaster process. Most meetings start on the hour, creating massive synchronized load spikes that stressed every layer of their infrastructure. The company experienced mysterious 10-15 second delays when connecting to PostgreSQL, where TCP connections would establish successfully but the database wouldn't respond to startup messages for significant periods.

The root cause was PostgreSQL's postmaster process, which runs a single-threaded main loop responsible for spawning and managing all database connections and worker processes. Under their extreme workload with high worker churn, this single-threaded loop consumed an entire CPU core, creating a bottleneck that slowed connection establishment, parallel queries, and signal handling. This revealed a rarely-encountered PostgreSQL scaling limitation that only manifests under exceptionally high load patterns like Recall.ai's synchronized meeting start times.

## https://www.biometricupdate.com/202602/ice-seeks-industry-input-on-ad-tech-location-data-for-investigative-use

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has issued a Request for Information (RFI) seeking commercial advertising technology tools that can provide location data and analytics for federal investigations. The agency is exploring how ad tech platforms—which routinely collect device identifiers, IP addresses, GPS coordinates, and behavioral data for targeted advertising—can be repurposed as investigative tools. ICE emphasizes this is market research rather than procurement, though it signals interest in vendor demonstrations that typically precede pilot programs.

The inquiry raises significant privacy concerns, as it suggests federal agencies may access highly sensitive personal data by purchasing it from commercial brokers rather than obtaining warrants. Critics argue this approach circumvents Fourth Amendment protections, while ICE claims to be considering "regulatory constraints and privacy expectations" without providing specifics on safeguards, retention policies, or judicial authorization. The RFI's emphasis on "Ad Tech compliant" services—which refers to industry self-regulation rather than law enforcement legal standards—highlights tensions between commercial data practices and constitutional protections, particularly given ICE's broad mandate spanning criminal, civil, and administrative investigations.

## https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/02/05/0030225/valves-steam-machine-has-been-delayed-and-the-ram-crisis-will-impact-pricing

Valve has delayed the launch of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller hardware from Q1 2026 to a vague "first half of the year" timeframe due to ongoing memory and storage shortages affecting the tech industry. The company cited rising component prices and limited availability as reasons for revisiting both the shipping schedule and pricing strategy.

Despite the delay, Valve maintains that the Steam Machine will still be positioned at the entry level of the PC market, though entry-level PC prices themselves are rising due to the RAM crisis. The shortage has been attributed to high demand from AI companies and other tech sectors competing for limited supply.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/05/0036222/bmw-commits-to-subscriptions-even-after-heated-seat-debacle

Here's a concise summary:

BMW is continuing its push for subscription-based vehicle features despite backlash over its controversial plan to charge monthly fees for heated seats. While the company backed away from the heated seat subscription model, a spokesperson confirmed BMW "remains fully committed" to its ConnectedDrive platform, which will charge recurring fees for features requiring data connectivity as part of its global aftersales strategy.

The article highlights the distinction between subscriptions for services requiring ongoing costs (like cellular data, map updates, and traffic information) and charging for hardware already installed in the vehicle, like heated seats. Many commenters criticized the subscription model, particularly for features that don't require external services, viewing it as exploitative "rent-seeking" behavior. The controversy extends beyond BMW, as other manufacturers like Lexus and Mercedes also implement similar subscription models for various vehicle features.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/05/0023249/microsoft-adds-sysmon-to-windows

Microsoft has integrated Sysmon, a popular system monitoring tool from its Sysinternals suite, directly into Windows for the first time. The feature is now available in Windows Insider builds and addresses a long-standing challenge for enterprise administrators who previously had to manually deploy and manage Sysmon across thousands of computers. The tool allows administrators to capture system events, filter specific activity, and send data to Windows event logs for security monitoring and SIEM integration.

The built-in Sysmon ships disabled by default and requires PowerShell to enable. Notably, any existing standalone Sysmon installations must be uninstalled before activating the integrated version. Microsoft's Mark Russinovich had previously acknowledged that Sysmon lacked official customer support in production environments, a gap this integration aims to fill for enterprise users seeking better system monitoring capabilities.

## https://science.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/2046202/russian-spy-satellites-have-intercepted-eu-communications-satellites

Here is a 1-2 paragraph summary:

European security officials have confirmed that two Russian spy satellites, Luch-1 and Luch-2, have been conducting surveillance operations by positioning themselves near European communications satellites in geostationary orbit. The Russian satellites have made repeated close approaches to at least a dozen key European satellites over the past three years, lingering nearby for weeks at a time to intercept communications. Since its 2023 launch, Luch-2 alone has approached 17 European satellites. Officials are concerned that Russia could not only compromise sensitive information but potentially manipulate satellite trajectories or crash them.

This intensified shadowing activity has occurred during heightened tensions between Russia and the West following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The targeted satellites service Europe, including the UK, as well as parts of Africa and the Middle East. While the article notes that the U.S. also conducts similar satellite surveillance operations, the close physical proximity and operational risks posed by the Russian vehicles have raised particular security concerns among European space authorities.

## https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/1826249/everyone-is-stealing-tv

A widespread informal market for rogue streaming devices has emerged across the U.S., driven by consumers frustrated with rising TV subscription costs. Chinese-manufactured devices like SuperBox and vSeeBox, sold for $200-$400 through resellers at farmers markets and online, use legal hardware but direct users to pirate streaming apps offering 6,000-8,000 channels including premium sports and local stations. Some content is allegedly ripped directly from legitimate services like Dish's Sling TV, with the company's logo still visible on feeds.

Despite aggressive legal action by companies like Dish Network—which has won over $1.6 million in damages from various resellers—adoption continues unabated. These devices represent an evolution of earlier products like TVPad, which sold 3 million units to Asian expat communities before being shut down through litigation. The current generation has simply expanded to mainstream American audiences, creating a thriving black market that legal efforts have failed to significantly curtail.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/1810206/as-software-stocks-slump-investors-debate-ais-existential-threat

# Summary

Software stocks experienced significant declines this week, with the S&P 500 software and services index falling nearly 4% on Tuesday and an additional 1% on Wednesday. The selloff was triggered by Anthropic's new legal tool for their Claude AI model, which highlights how large language models are increasingly moving into the "application layer" and competing directly with established enterprise software companies. 

Investors are now grappling with an existential question: whether AI represents a fundamental threat to traditional software businesses across industries like finance, law, and coding. The concern stems from AI companies needing to generate revenue from enterprise applications to fund their massive infrastructure investments, potentially displacing the lucrative software tools that currently serve these industries. The market volatility reflects uncertainty about which companies will survive this disruption and whether AI will truly transform these sectors or prove less impactful than anticipated.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/1327223/anthropic-pledges-to-keep-claude-ad-free-calls-ai-conversations-a-space-to-think

Here's a concise summary:

**Summary:**

Anthropic has pledged to keep its AI assistant Claude completely ad-free, positioning it as a "space to think" without commercial interruption. The announcement comes shortly after rival OpenAI revealed plans to introduce advertising to ChatGPT. Anthropic justified the decision by noting that many Claude conversations involve sensitive or personal topics, and that an ad-based model would create harmful incentives to maximize engagement rather than usefulness.

Instead of advertising, Anthropic generates revenue through enterprise contracts, paid subscriptions, and is exploring "agentic commerce" where Claude could handle purchases on behalf of users—but only when user-initiated, not advertiser-driven. However, commenters on the article expressed skepticism about the pledge's longevity, drawing comparisons to Google's abandoned "Don't be evil" motto and suggesting that financial pressures will eventually lead to ads being introduced despite current promises.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/114220/pinterest-sacks-workers-for-creating-tool-to-track-layoffs

Pinterest fired two engineers who created a script to track which employees were laid off during recent job cuts. The company announced it would cut about 15% of its workforce (roughly 700 people) to focus on an "AI-forward approach," but didn't disclose which specific workers or teams were affected. The engineers developed a tool that monitored internal communication platforms like Slack to detect when employee accounts were being deactivated or removed, revealing who had been let go.

Pinterest justified the firings by stating the engineers violated company policy by improperly accessing confidential information and sharing it broadly, calling it a breach of their former colleagues' privacy. The incident highlights tensions between corporate transparency during layoffs and employee privacy, as well as workers' desire to understand how restructuring affects their colleagues when companies choose not to disclose such details publicly.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/099210/why-googles-android-for-pc-launch-may-be-messy-and-controversial

Google's plan to merge Android and ChromeOS into a new operating system called "Aluminium" faces significant challenges, according to court documents from its antitrust case. The new OS won't be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware and will require more powerful specifications to run. This incompatibility means Google must maintain ChromeOS in parallel through at least 2033 to honor its 10-year support commitment to current users.

The rollout timeline is also more protracted than Google has publicly suggested. While executives described the merger as coming "next year," court filings reveal commercial testing won't begin until late 2026, with a full consumer release not expected until 2028. Enterprise and education customers—ChromeOS's primary market—will also have to wait until 2028, meaning years of running two parallel operating systems and a potentially messy transition period for existing users.

## https://it.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/0730222/adobe-actually-wont-discontinue-animate

Adobe has reversed its decision to discontinue Adobe Animate, following significant backlash from creators. The company announced it will keep the animation and game development software available in "maintenance mode" rather than shutting it down on March 1st as originally planned. Users, including prominent animators like David Firth (creator of Salad Fingers), expressed frustration over the initial discontinuation announcement.

While Adobe now states users will "always have access" to Animate and their content, the software will only receive security and bug fixes without new features. The change means Adobe will continue selling the product to new and existing users, though the practical difference from the original plan—which already promised three years of maintenance—is minimal beyond continued availability for purchase through Creative Cloud subscriptions.

## https://games.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/0735217/amd-hints-the-next-gen-xbox-console-could-launch-next-year

AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed during an earnings call that the company's development of Microsoft's next-generation Xbox System-on-Chip (SoC) is "progressing well to support a launch in 2027." While this doesn't definitively confirm the next Xbox's release date, it strongly suggests Microsoft could be preparing to launch its new console next year.

The announcement comes amid ongoing concerns about RAM shortages and their potential impact on pricing and availability. There is also growing competition in the gaming space from PC-based alternatives like the Steam Machine and cloud gaming services, raising questions about the viability of traditional console releases in the current market.

## https://developers.slashdot.org/story/26/02/04/075248/say-hello-to-googlesql

Google has renamed its open-source SQL analysis and parsing project from ZetaSQL to GoogleSQL to align the branding with the SQL dialect already used across its cloud products like BigQuery and Spanner. This is purely a naming change with no technical modifications—the code, features, and development team remain unchanged.

The rebranding aims to reduce developer confusion by using a single name (GoogleSQL) for both the open-source tooling and the SQL dialect that has long been used internally at Google. The project, which dates back to at least 2014, provides an analyzer framework for SQL and allows BigQuery users to run the parser independently for validation purposes without using the full database engine.

## https://dev.to/richardpascoe/moltbook-is-not-an-ai-society-4h6d

# Summary

Moltbook, which has been marketed as an "AI-only social network" populated by autonomous agents, is actually misleading according to this critical analysis. The platform has no verification system to prove that "agents" are actually AI-driven rather than human-operated. Humans can easily register as "agents" and post content indistinguishable from AI output, making claims of "emergent AI behavior" unverifiable. The author argues that what appears to be autonomous AI activity is typically human-curated automation involving prompted outputs, scripts, and human guidance.

The fundamental problem is the lack of verifiable identity and provenance—there's no way to confirm whether agents are model-driven or human-driven, whether behavior is spontaneous or scripted, or whether output reflects genuine autonomy. The author contends that Moltbook is more accurately described as a bot-friendly posting platform and experimentation sandbox rather than an autonomous AI society. For meaningful progress in multi-agent systems, the author advocates for verifiable agent identity, clear separation of human control from autonomous action, and safety measures—prioritizing technical precision over marketing hype.

## https://dev.to/itsugo/why-do-you-write-5bkf

In this reflective article, developer Aryan Choudhary explores why writing has become an essential practice for him beyond coding. He explains that after mentally demanding days of debugging and context-switching, writing provides a different kind of relief—it's a way to clarify thoughts without the pressure of finding correct solutions, helping externalize half-formed ideas and reduce emotional noise. Unlike coding, which requires precision and efficiency, writing allows him to process uncertainty, move slowly around concepts, and understand what he thinks through the act of writing itself.

Choudhary also describes writing as a form of "recovery" rather than productivity, serving multiple purposes: it tests his understanding (if he can't explain something simply, he doesn't truly grasp it), helps him process emotions without venting, and unexpectedly aids memory retention. He concludes by thanking the DEV Community for their support, noting he recently crossed 3,000 followers and values the meaningful conversations that have emerged, where readers share how his honest, consistent writing has helped them articulate their own experiences.

## https://dev.to/sylwia-lask/stop-installing-libraries-10-browser-apis-that-already-solve-your-problems-35bi

This article highlights 10 underused browser APIs that can replace external libraries for common web development tasks. The author argues that modern browsers have powerful built-in capabilities that many developers overlook, including APIs for deep cloning objects (Structured Clone), measuring performance, detecting tab visibility, observing element resizing and viewport intersection, canceling operations (AbortController), and detecting user idle states.

Additional APIs covered include BroadcastChannel for multi-tab communication, Web Locks for preventing duplicate work across tabs, and File System Access for reading/writing local files. While most APIs enjoy broad modern browser support, some like Idle Detection, Web Locks, and File System Access remain primarily Chromium-based. The author emphasizes that knowing these native features exist can reduce bundle sizes, improve performance, and lower code complexity compared to installing third-party libraries.

## https://dev.to/art_light/should-junior-developers-still-learn-javascript-the-hard-way-4j0l

# Summary

This article argues that junior developers in 2026 should still learn JavaScript fundamentals "the hard way" – meaning understanding vanilla JavaScript, core concepts, and what happens under the hood before jumping into frameworks. The author distinguishes between learning the "hard way" (intentional, foundational learning) and the "stupid way" (boring, contrived exercises).

The key argument is that while AI tools and frameworks allow rapid development, they become crutches without solid fundamentals. Understanding concepts like closures, scope, the event loop, and async behavior enables developers to debug effectively rather than guess when things break. Frameworks change constantly, but JavaScript fundamentals remain stable. The author recommends a balanced approach: learn core JavaScript concepts through small real-world projects, then adopt frameworks – emphasizing that skipping fundamentals is risky, but staying only in vanilla JS forever is pointless. The goal is to build understanding that pays off when frameworks evolve, AI tools fail, or production issues arise.

## https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/5/the-world-factbook/#atom-everything

The CIA has discontinued The World Factbook, a public intelligence publication that has been running since 1971 and available online since 1997. In what the author calls "cultural vandalism," the CIA removed the entire website including all archives, redirecting every page to a closure announcement without providing any explanation for the decision.

Since The World Factbook has always been public domain, blogger Simon Willison downloaded the 2020 archived version from the Internet Archive and republished it on GitHub with GitHub Pages enabled, making it accessible to the public. Willison criticizes the CIA's decision to completely remove the valuable resource rather than simply marking it as no longer maintained, noting that annual archives up to 2020 are still available through the Internet Archive.

## https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/voxtral-2/#atom-everything

Mistral has released Voxtral Transcribe 2, a new family of audio-to-text transcription models that serve as a sequel to their original Voxtral from July 2025. The family includes an open-source model called Voxtral Realtime (Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602) available under Apache-2.0 license as an 8.87GB download, and a closed-weight model called voxtral-mini-latest accessible via the Mistral API. Both models offer impressive real-time transcription capabilities, accurately handling technical jargon and fast speech.

The closed-weight model is priced at $0.003 per minute ($0.18/hour) and includes features like speaker diarization, context biasing, and timestamp granularities. Mistral has also launched a speech-to-text playground in their API console that allows users to upload audio files and receive diarized transcripts with options to export in text, SRT, or JSON formats. The live demo showcased impressive performance with immediate transcription of speech including technical terms like "Django" and "WebAssembly."

## https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/4/distributing-go-binaries/#atom-everything

Simon Willison has developed a method to distribute Go binaries through PyPI (Python's package repository) using a new tool called go-to-wheel. The approach leverages PyPI's platform-specific wheel distribution system to automatically deliver the correct compiled binary for each user's operating system and architecture. When installed via pip or uv, the Python wrapper locates and executes the bundled Go binary, making it trivially easy to run tools like his sqlite-scanner (which finds SQLite databases by checking file headers) with a simple `uvx sqlite-scanner` command.

This distribution pattern enables Go binaries to be used as dependencies in Python packages, combining Go's strengths (speed, small binaries, excellent concurrency) with Python's ecosystem. Willison demonstrates this with datasette-scan, a Datasette plugin that depends on sqlite-scanner and uses subprocess calls to leverage the Go binary's functionality. The go-to-wheel tool automates the process of creating platform-specific Python wheels from Go projects, handling the packaging complexity so developers can easily publish cross-platform Go tools to PyPI where they "just work" for Python users without requiring Go installation.

## https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/3/introducing-deno-sandbox/#atom-everything

Deno has launched Deno Sandbox, a hosted sandbox service within their Deno Deploy platform that can be accessed using multiple programming languages, including Python and JavaScript. The sandboxes offer robust resources (up to 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs, 10GB ephemeral storage), support persistent volumes and custom snapshots, and allow sessions up to 30 minutes with billing based on actual CPU time and resource usage.

The service's standout security feature is its handling of API secrets: instead of exposing actual secret values inside the sandbox, it uses placeholder tokens that are intercepted and replaced by a proxy when making allowed outbound API calls. This prevents malicious code or prompt injections from exfiltrating the real secrets, since the actual values never exist within the sandbox environment itself—only the placeholder tokens do.
