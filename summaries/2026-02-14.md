# Summary

The article introduces **inline-snapshot**, a Python testing library that significantly improves how developers write and maintain tests for complex data structures. Traditional snapshot testing requires manually writing expected values or storing them in separate files, which is tedious and creates maintenance headaches. Inline-snapshot elegantly solves this by allowing developers to write empty `snapshot()` placeholders and automatically populating them with actual values using `pytest --inline-snapshot=fix`, making it easy to update multiple tests at once when data structures change.

The article demonstrates practical techniques for handling real-world testing challenges, such as combining inline-snapshot with **dirty-equals** (another Pydantic library) to handle dynamic values like timestamps or random IDs using matchers like `IsInt()` or `IsNow()`. It also showcases advanced patterns like converting data to built-in types before snapshotting for robustness, and nesting snapshots within conditional assertions for complex nested structures. The author illustrates these concepts with real examples from the OpenAI Agents SDK, where this approach enabled comprehensive test coverage with minimal effort while improving both test quality and developer velocity.

# Summary

Fusion startup Helion announced a major milestone by achieving plasma temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius in its Polaris prototype reactor—75% of the way toward its commercial operating target. The company also became the first fusion company to operate using deuterium-tritium fuel. Helion is racing toward a 2028 deadline to deliver electricity to Microsoft using its larger Orion commercial reactor, positioning itself ahead of competitors who typically target the early 2030s.

Helion's unique approach involves using a field-reversed configuration reactor design that directly converts fusion reactions into electricity rather than extracting heat like competitors do. The company ultimately aims to reach 200 million degrees Celsius and plans to transition to deuterium-helium-3 fuel, which it must manufacture itself. With $425 million in recent funding and ambitious technical innovations, Helion is part of a competitive fusion energy landscape attracting significant investor interest, though it remains to be seen whether any company can successfully commercialize fusion power at scale.
