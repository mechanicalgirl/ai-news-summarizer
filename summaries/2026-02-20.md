Hacker News

# Summary

Jens Gustedt announces that the `defer` feature—a cleanup mechanism for C—is now available in both gcc and clang compilers. A formal technical specification (TS 25755) has been completed and is moving through ISO publication procedures, with implementations available in clang-22 and a workaround available for gcc-9 onward. The defer feature eliminates common programming issues like resource leaks and blocked mutexes by automatically executing cleanup code when exiting a function scope, regardless of the exit path taken.

The article provides practical code examples showing how `defer` simplifies resource management, such as automatically freeing allocated memory or unlocking mutexes without requiring complex exit-handling logic. While the gcc fallback relies on nested functions (a debated feature), the author assures that it produces no unsafe runtime overhead. However, older clang versions are not supported due to incompatible semantics in their "blocks" extension.

# Summary

Researchers introduced Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM), a novel approach that accelerates diffusion-based language model inference by up to 14.5x without sacrificing quality. While traditional diffusion language models generate text by iteratively refining masked sequences over multiple steps (enabling parallel token generation), they suffer from two key inefficiencies: incompatibility with standard KV caching due to bidirectional attention, and the need for many refinement steps to maintain quality. CDLM solves these problems through a post-training method that combines consistency-based multi-token finalization with block-wise KV caching.

The method works by collecting refinement trajectories from a teacher diffusion model, then training a student model with block-causal attention using three complementary objectives: distillation loss, consistency loss, and masked-denoising loss. Results show CDLM reduces refinement steps by 4.1x-7.7x across benchmarks while achieving latency speedups up to 14.5x on coding and math tasks, establishing diffusion models as a competitive alternative to traditional autoregressive language models for faster inference.

## https://github.com/olvvier/apple-silicon-accelerometer

Hacker News

# Summary

This GitHub repository provides code to access the undocumented MEMS accelerometer built into Apple Silicon MacBooks (M1/M2/M3/M4 chips). The accelerometer, managed by the Sensor Processing Unit (SPU), is not exposed through any public API. The project uses IOKit HID callbacks to read raw 3-axis acceleration data at approximately 800Hz, with data delivered as 22-byte HID reports containing x/y/z coordinates as 32-bit integers.

The implementation consists of two main Python files: `spu_sensor.py` handles the core IOKit bindings and device communication, while `motion_live.py` demonstrates a practical application using ballistocardiography to detect heartbeats through vibrations transmitted through the laptop chassis. The project requires root access and is currently only tested on MacBook Pro M3 Pro running macOS 15.6.1, with a disclaimer that it may break on future macOS updates.

Hacker News

# Summary

**micasa** is a terminal-based UI application for managing and tracking all aspects of home ownership—maintenance schedules, projects, incidents, appliances, vendors, quotes, and documents. It operates entirely locally using a single SQLite file with no cloud storage, accounts, or subscriptions required. The tool helps homeowners answer common questions like when filters were last changed, warranty status, vendor history, and incident logs, all accessible through a keyboard-driven, Vim-style interface.

The application was created to replace scattered physical records (receipts, binders, sticky notes) with an organized digital system that runs on any machine. It's available for Linux, macOS, and Windows, can be installed via Go, and features a modal keyboard-driven interface inspired by VisiData for efficient browsing and data management.

## https://sour.coffee/2026/02/20/an-arm-homelab-server-or-a-minisforum-ms-r1-review/

Hacker News

# Summary

The author reviews the Minisforum MS-R1, an affordable ARM-based mini PC they added to their homelab. After assembling the barebones unit and attempting Rocky Linux installation, they encountered driver issues with the onboard Realtek NICs and ultimately switched to Fedora, which included necessary drivers. The MS-R1 succeeds as a powerful, reasonably-priced ARM server alternative to expensive Mac hardware like the Mac Studio.

While the MS-R1 has drawbacks—including limited M.2 storage expansion, undetected Marvell NICs, and power-on-after-outage issues—the author considers it a solid early-adopter addition to their homelab that avoids breaking the bank. They note the ARM ecosystem remains small compared to x86, but the MS-R1 works well as a headless hypervisor running FreeBSD virtual machines, demonstrating that practical ARM servers no longer require choosing between underpowered systems or prohibitively expensive Apple hardware.

## https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/

Hacker News

# Summary

Over four years running infrastructure at a startup, the author reflects on major architectural decisions, endorsing most AWS choices including EKS, RDS, ElastiCache, ECR, and Control Tower with Terraform. He regrets using EKS managed addons (switching to Helm instead) and AWS premium support due to high costs, while cautioning against multiple applications sharing a single database and underutilizing serverless/FaaS solutions for CPU workloads.

On the process side, the author strongly recommends implementing automation for incident management (Slack bots for post-mortems, PagerDuty reviews), adopting GitOps for infrastructure-as-code, and holding regular cost tracking meetings. He advises against managing post-mortems in DataDog or PagerDuty directly, preferring flexible wiki-style tools like Notion instead. The overarching lesson is prioritizing team efficiency and simplicity in infrastructure decisions.

# Summary

An anonymous donor in Japan has given Osaka City 21kg of gold bars worth approximately $3.6 million to help repair the city's aging water infrastructure. The mystery donor, who previously contributed 500,000 yen in cash for municipal waterworks, made the donation last November. Osaka Mayor Hideyuki Yokoyama expressed gratitude for the "staggering" donation, which will be used to address the city's deteriorating water and sewage pipes.

The donation is particularly timely, as Japan's aging infrastructure poses significant challenges. Osaka recorded over 90 water pipe leaks in the 2024 fiscal year, and more than 20% of Japan's water pipes have exceeded their 40-year service lifespan. Budget constraints have hindered pipe renewal efforts nationwide, though recent incidents—including a deadly sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture caused by a ruptured sewage pipe—have prompted authorities to increase replacement efforts.
