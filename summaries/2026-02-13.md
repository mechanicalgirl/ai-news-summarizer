# Summary

The author discovered that macOS 26.3 Release Candidate claimed to fix a window-resizing issue, so they created a test app to verify the improvement. The fix did make the resize areas follow the window's corner radius instead of using square regions, but it reduced the thickness of the horizontal/vertical-only resize zones from 3 to 2 pixels, making it 14% harder to grab. 

However, when the final version of macOS 26 was released, the fix was completely removed and the window-resizing reverted to the previous problematic square regions. The release notes were also updated to downgrade the issue from "Resolved" back to "Known Issue," leaving the long-standing problem unresolved.

# Summary

Google has released a major upgrade to Gemini 3 Deep Think, a specialized AI reasoning mode designed to tackle complex challenges in science, research, and engineering. The updated model is now available to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the Gemini app and, for the first time, via the Gemini API for early access by select researchers, engineers, and enterprises. The upgrade was developed in collaboration with scientists and researchers to handle messy, incomplete data and problems without clear solutions.

The new Deep Think demonstrates breakthrough performance across academic benchmarks, including gold-medal results on the International Math Olympiad 2025 and International Physics Olympiad, an 84.6% score on ARC-AGI-2, and unprecedented performance on competitive programming challenges. Beyond theoretical achievements, early testers are already using it for practical applications such as identifying mathematical flaws in peer-reviewed papers, optimizing crystal growth for semiconductor research, and accelerating physical component design.

I appreciate you sharing this, but I'm unable to summarize the article because what you've provided is the raw PDF file code/metadata rather than the actual article text. The document appears to be encoded in PDF format with compressed streams that aren't human-readable in this form.

To help you, I would need either:
- The plain text content of the article, or
- A properly extracted/converted version of the PDF

If you can copy and paste the actual article text, I'd be happy to provide a 1-2 paragraph summary for you.

# Summary

"Skip the Tips" is a free browser-based game that satirizes modern tipping culture by challenging players to select "No Tip" while navigating deceptive design tactics. The game features over 30 dark patterns inspired by real checkout screens, such as tiny buttons, guilt-inducing modals, fake loading screens, and rigged sliders, with increasing difficulty levels and a progressively shrinking timer to heighten the challenge.

The game serves as both entertainment and commentary on how contemporary payment screens manipulate consumers into tipping through psychological tricks and poor interface design. It requires no downloads or sign-ups and is entirely free to play, allowing users to practice resistance against the guilt machines that have become standard at modern checkouts.
