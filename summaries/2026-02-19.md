## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/github-agentic-workflows/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

GitHub has launched Agentic Workflows in technical preview, enabling developers to automate complex repository tasks using AI coding agents. These workflows are defined in simple Markdown files that describe desired outcomes, which agents then execute through GitHub Actions. The system prioritizes security through isolated sandboxes, firewalled agent access, read-only permissions by default, and reviewable controls for write operations, allowing AI decision-making to safely integrate into CI/CD processes while keeping humans in the loop.

The feature supports automation tasks like issue triage, documentation updates, CI troubleshooting, and code quality improvements. However, the announcement has generated some skepticism on Hacker News regarding the necessity of continuous AI involvement in CI/CD pipelines and concerns about workflow complexity and potential repository spam from automated AI refactorings. The Agentic Workflows remain in technical preview and are not yet production-ready.

## https://www.infoq.com/presentations/panel-modern-data-architectures/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

This article features a panel discussion on modern data architectures from QCon London, where industry experts emphasize that data engineering has evolved beyond simple "click-and-drag" UI tools and is now a serious discipline requiring proper software engineering practices. The panelists—including Adi Polak from Confluent, Sarah Usher, Matthias Niehoff from codecentric, and Fabiane Nardon from TOTVS—are experienced professionals who transitioned from traditional software engineering to data engineering roles.

A key discussion point addresses the confusion around the distinction between software engineers, data engineers, and data analysts, and how to encourage software engineers to transition into data engineering without viewing it as a career step backward. The panelists stress that data engineering requires hands-on learning and real-world experience, and that the software engineering best practices developers have learned—such as testing, CI/CD, and proper code practices—are equally valuable and applicable in the data world. The message is clear: data engineering is legitimate software engineering applied to data, not just a lesser technical pursuit.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/dropbox-context-engine/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Dropbox has built a scalable context engine for Dropbox Dash that shifts away from real-time API calls toward pre-processed, indexed retrieval to support enterprise AI knowledge search. The architecture normalizes and enriches data from connected applications before indexing using lexical search and dense vectors, while leveraging knowledge graphs to create relationship models that are pre-computed and fed into the indexing pipeline rather than queried at runtime. This approach sacrifices some complexity and storage costs but delivers improved latency, relevance, and predictable query-time performance.

The team also addressed challenges with integrating multiple tools into language models by consolidating retrieval behind a small number of high-level tools, avoiding context window bloat. Additionally, they implemented continuous evaluation using language models as judges to measure retrieval quality and optimized prompts at scale using DSPy, enabling rapid model switching. This broader pattern—treating context as a first-class system that is pre-computed and carefully constrained rather than assembled on-the-fly—is emerging across enterprise AI assistants as organizations scale their search and agent capabilities.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/uber-openai-rate-limiting/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Uber and OpenAI have both redesigned their rate-limiting systems, moving away from traditional counter-based, per-service approaches to adaptive, policy-based systems implemented at the infrastructure layer. Uber's new Global Rate Limiter (GRL) uses a three-tier feedback loop to manage traffic across 80 million requests per second, replacing hard stops with soft controls that drop a configurable percentage of traffic rather than shutting down services entirely. This approach eliminated operational inefficiencies like Redis latency and reduced tail latency while maintaining system resilience.

OpenAI took a similar architectural direction but prioritized user experience for its Codex and Sora applications. Rather than blocking users with hard rate limits, OpenAI implemented a "waterfall" system that allows users to continue accessing services through a credit-based mechanism when rate limits are exceeded. Using a dedicated real-time access engine that synchronously evaluates available capacity and credit balances, OpenAI maintains low latency while enabling seamless, continuous user experience. Both companies report their systems successfully handle massive scale—Uber has absorbed 15x traffic surges and DDoS attacks, while OpenAI delivers real-time, accurate billing without interrupting user workflow.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/kimi-k25-swarm/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Moonshot AI has released Kimi K2.5, an open-weight multimodal language model that combines advanced coding capabilities with vision functionality, achieving benchmark scores comparable to frontier models like GPT-5 and Gemini. The model introduces four operational modes, with the standout Agent Swarm feature enabling up to 100 sub-agents to work in parallel on decomposed tasks, reducing execution time while improving performance on complex workflows.

The Agent Swarm capability was developed using a novel Parallel Agent Reinforcement Learning (PARL) technique that trains an orchestrator to automatically decide when to create sub-agents and delegate work, rather than following predefined workflows. Kimi K2.5 outperformed GPT-5.2 Pro and Claude Opus 4.5 on specific benchmarks and offers improved context management without requiring summarization, positioning it as a significant step toward AGI in the open-source community.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/leapwork-ai-testing/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Leapwork's research reveals a significant gap between enthusiasm for AI in testing and actual adoption confidence. While 88% of organizations prioritize AI in their testing strategy and 80% believe it will positively impact testing, only 12.6% have deployed AI across key test workflows. The primary barriers are concerns about accuracy and reliability—54% cite quality worries as holding back broader adoption—along with practical challenges like fragile tests, high maintenance costs (with 45% spending 3+ days updating tests after system changes), and limited automation coverage (currently only 41% of testing is automated).

The research, supported by similar findings from Puppet, GitLab, and Tricentis, demonstrates that successful AI adoption in testing depends on building a stable, mature automation foundation first. Rather than treating AI as a standalone solution, organizations achieve the greatest impact by pairing AI capabilities with resilient automation practices. The consensus is clear: innovation matters less than reliability—teams need trustworthy, maintainable automation infrastructure to confidently scale AI-driven testing without sacrificing quality outcomes.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/opanai-codex-app-server/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

OpenAI has published the architecture of its Codex App Server, a bidirectional protocol that decouples the Codex AI coding agent's core logic from multiple client surfaces (CLI, VS Code, web, desktop apps, and IDE integrations). The App Server uses three conversation primitives—Items (atomic input/output units), Turns (sequences of agent work), and Threads (durable session containers)—communicated via JSON-RPC over stdio. This design enables complex interaction patterns like streaming diffs, approval flows, and session resumption that are essential for IDE integration.

The protocol also supports server-initiated requests and maintains backward compatibility. OpenAI deliberately chose this approach over the Model Context Protocol (MCP) due to MCP's insufficient session semantics for rich IDE interactions. The App Server is deployed across different environments—as embedded binaries for local clients, separate containers for web instances, and decoupled binaries for partners like Xcode. This work parallels industry standardization efforts like the Agent Client Protocol (ACP), reflecting ongoing efforts to establish universal standards for agent-editor communication.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/ai-agile-manifesto-debate/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

The article explores whether AI agents are making the Agile Manifesto obsolete. Steve Jones, a Capgemini executive, argues that AI-driven development fundamentally contradicts Agile's core values because: (1) tools now matter significantly—different AI platforms produce different results; (2) AI works too fast for traditional two-week sprints; and (3) AI-generated code may appear functional but accumulate hidden technical debt, making documentation and planning more critical than ever.

However, the debate reveals nuanced counterarguments. Critics contend that Agile is about adaptability and learning—principles that remain relevant regardless of speed—rather than specific sprint structures. Kent Beck, an original Agile Manifesto signatory, proposes "augmented coding" that maintains engineering rigor (clean code, testing, design) while leveraging AI assistance. Meanwhile, Forrester reports that 95% of professionals still view Agile as critical, with half already integrating generative AI into agile practices. The consensus suggests not that Agile is dead, but that its practices and methodologies must evolve to accommodate non-human developers, potentially requiring new frameworks like "Intent Design" and "Agentic Delivery Lifecycles."

## https://www.infoq.com/articles/proactive-autoscaling-edge-kubernetes/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Kubernetes' standard Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) often reacts too slowly and inefficiently to traffic spikes at the edge, where resources are limited and latency is critical. The HPA uses a rigid proportional scaling formula that lacks flexibility for domain-specific logic, cannot account for pod startup delays, and treats short-lived traffic bursts as sustained load, causing unnecessary over-scaling or oscillation.

To address these limitations, custom autoscalers like the Custom Pod Autoscaler (CPA) offer a more effective solution for edge environments. These alternatives enable engineers to incorporate multiple metrics (such as response time and latency SLOs alongside CPU), account for pod startup times, implement gradual scale-down policies, and maintain CPU headroom to prevent latency degradation during unpredictable workload spikes—all critical for maintaining performance and reliability in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/chrome-temporal-date-api/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Chrome 144 has officially shipped the Temporal API, a modern JavaScript date and time solution that addresses long-standing issues with the legacy Date object. Temporal provides distinct types for different use cases, explicit time zone handling, immutable values, and built-in calendar support, offering developers a native alternative to third-party libraries like Moment.js and Luxon. The API is positioned as a full replacement for Date, enabling clearer code and eliminating common pitfalls around time zone confusion and mutable date arithmetic.

While developers have largely welcomed Temporal as a relief from relying on external libraries for fundamental date handling, widespread adoption may be delayed due to incomplete browser support across Safari and mobile platforms. The proposal remains at Stage 3 standardization, with teams expected to migrate incrementally as ecosystem support improves. Over time, existing date libraries will likely shift toward serving as convenience wrappers rather than patching core language gaps.

## https://www.infoq.com/presentations/distributed-micro-frontends/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Luca Mezzalira presents a framework for designing ideal micro-frontends platforms, drawing from his experience architecting DAZN's live sports streaming application. He defines micro-frontends as technical representations of business subdomains that allow independent team implementation using different technologies while minimizing shared code. The talk emphasizes that micro-frontends are far more complex than simply loading components at runtime, and that proper architecture requires understanding business boundaries through domain-driven design.

Mezzalira discusses how to structure teams for autonomous ownership across the full stack—including microservices, data mesh, and micro-frontends—and provides decision frameworks covering composition, routing, and communication patterns. Key sociotechnical benefits include reducing external dependencies, enabling 25+ deployments per day, and using guardrails and discovery services to maintain architecture standards while allowing team independence.

## https://www.infoq.com/news/2026/02/agoda-api-agent/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

Agoda has developed API Agent, an open-source system that converts any REST or GraphQL API into a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server without requiring code or deployments. The system uses schema introspection to automatically understand API structures and generate natural language queries, allowing multiple APIs to be served through a single MCP instance. Configuration updates are the only requirement to add new APIs.

The architecture leverages FastMCP, OpenAI's Agents SDK, and DuckDB to manage large API responses efficiently. DuckDB acts as a context-management layer, filtering and aggregating data in SQL before sending results to language models, preventing token overflow and avoiding arbitrary code execution. The system prioritizes security by operating in read-only mode by default, with mutations blocked unless explicitly enabled and whitelisted for internal tools.

## https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/building-resilient-event-driven-microservices/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

In this InfoQ podcast episode, Thomas Betts interviews Muzeeb Mohammad, a senior software engineer at JP Morgan Chase, about building resilient event-driven microservices for financial systems. Mohammad explains how event-driven architectures, particularly using Kafka, improve upon traditional monolithic and RESTful approaches by decoupling backend processes and enabling asynchronous workflows. He illustrates this with a practical example of customer account opening at SEI, where loosely coupling systems for credit checks, fraud detection, and account creation through event streaming allowed the organization to meet SLA requirements while improving scalability and time to market.

The discussion covers key principles and patterns for event-driven architectures, the challenges specific to highly-regulated financial industries, and critical requirements including observability, traceability, and embedded security in the engineering workflow. Mohammad also addresses modernization strategies for legacy financial systems by having mainframe-based COBOL systems emit events, and discusses how teams can safely adopt AI for engineering workflows before moving to business-facing use cases.

## https://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-agentic-mlops-a2a-mcp/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global

# Summary

This article presents an architectural pattern for building scalable, multi-agent systems by layering two emerging protocols: Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP). A2A serves as the communication bus enabling agents to discover and communicate with each other, while MCP acts as a universal language for agent capabilities and tools. The authors demonstrate this layered approach through an MLOps use case where an Orchestrator agent coordinates with Validation and Deployment agents.

The key advantage of this architecture is its ability to move beyond rigid, static pipelines toward dynamic, adaptable systems where new capabilities can be added without changing core communication logic. Rather than rewriting pipelines when business requirements change, organizations can compose new agent capabilities modularly. While illustrated through MLOps, this layered A2A-MCP pattern applies broadly to any domain requiring dynamic collaboration and intelligent automation among specialized agents.
