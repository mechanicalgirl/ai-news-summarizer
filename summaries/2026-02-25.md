### Defense against uploads: Q&A with OSS file scanner, pompelmi - (Stack Overflow Blog)

https://stackoverflow.blog/2026/02/23/defense-against-uploads-oss-file-scanner-pompelmi/

# Summary

This Stack Overflow article features an interview with Tommaso Bertocchi, creator of pompelmi, an open-source file upload security scanner for Node.js applications. Despite being overlooked in favor of network and API security, file uploads remain a critical attack vector vulnerable to malware, denial-of-service attacks, and validation bypasses. Pompelmi addresses this gap by providing a developer-friendly, "plug-and-play" solution that scans files in-memory using streams and magic bytes without requiring deep security expertise or complex configuration.

The tool offers both sensible defaults (built-in policies, ZIP bomb detection, MIME validation) and flexibility through YARA-based custom scanning rules, allowing developers to start with solid baseline protection and enhance it over time. Bertocchi emphasizes that comprehensive security doesn't require constant vigilance of emerging threats—implementing strong fundamentals like strict allowlists and resource limits is more practical. As the sole maintainer, he's actively seeking corporate sponsorship or foundational support to scale the project and prevent burnout, aiming to transition pompelmi from a personal project into a professionally-maintained resource for the developer community.

### I'm helping my dog vibe code games - (Hacker News)

https://www.calebleak.com/posts/dog-game/

# Summary

Caleb Leak created a system where his 9-pound cavapoo, Momo, "designs" video games by typing randomly on a Bluetooth keyboard. The keystrokes are filtered through a Raspberry Pi and sent to Claude Code, which interprets the seemingly random input as cryptic game design instructions using a carefully crafted prompt. The system automatically rewards Momo with treats from a smart pet feeder when she types enough, and games are built in Godot 4.6 with 100% logic in C#. Typical games take 1-2 hours from initial keystrokes to a playable build.

To make the system work reliably, Leak built several key components: a keyboard interface that filters dangerous keys, automated screenshot and input-testing tools that let Claude QA its own games, and various linters to catch common Godot errors. The project was inspired after his dog accidentally walked across his keyboard in December, and he developed it after being laid off from Meta in January. The results have been surprisingly successful, with Claude learning to interpret cryptic input like "y7u8888888ftrg34BC" as detailed game concepts like a 3D frog bug-catching game.

### Cl-kawa: Scheme on Java on Common Lisp - (Hacker News)

https://github.com/atgreen/cl-kawa

# Summary

**cl-kawa** is a technology demonstration project that enables interoperability between Common Lisp and Scheme within a single process. It works by leveraging Kawa Scheme (which compiles Scheme to Java bytecode) and OpenLDK (a JVM implemented in Common Lisp that transpiles Java bytecode to Common Lisp). This allows developers to evaluate Scheme code from Common Lisp, call Scheme procedures, register Common Lisp functions for Scheme to call, and exchange basic values—all without serialization or process boundaries.

The project provides a simple API for integration, supporting operations like `kawa:eval` for executing Scheme expressions, `kawa:lookup` for accessing Scheme procedures, and `kawa:register` for exposing Common Lisp functions to Scheme. While functional and capable of demonstrating three-language interoperability (Common Lisp → Scheme → Java) in a single SBCL process, it is explicitly positioned as a proof-of-concept rather than a production-ready solution.

### Mercury 2: Fast reasoning LLM powered by diffusion - (Hacker News)

https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/blog/introducing-mercury-2

# Summary of Mercury 2 Introduction

Inception has introduced Mercury 2, the world's fastest reasoning language model, which addresses a critical bottleneck in production AI: sequential token generation. Unlike traditional autoregressive models that decode tokens one at a time, Mercury 2 uses a diffusion-based architecture that generates multiple tokens simultaneously through parallel refinement, achieving over 5x faster generation speeds (1,009 tokens/sec on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs) while maintaining competitive quality. The model is priced affordably at $0.25 per million input tokens and $0.75 per million output tokens.

Mercury 2 is optimized for latency-sensitive applications where user experience is critical, including coding autocomplete, agentic workflows, real-time voice interactions, and search/RAG pipelines. By dramatically reducing latency at each inference step, the model enables more complex reasoning chains and better outputs without sacrificing speed—fundamentally shifting the trade-off between reasoning quality and response time. The model is now available with OpenAI API compatibility, allowing seamless integration into existing systems.

### Show HN: Moonshine Open-Weights STT models – higher accuracy than WhisperLargev3 - (Hacker News)

https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine

# Summary

Moonshine is an open-source AI toolkit for building real-time voice applications with automatic speech recognition (ASR) that runs entirely on-device for speed, privacy, and offline functionality. The framework offers models ranging from tiny 26MB versions for constrained devices to larger models that exceed Whisper's accuracy, while maintaining significantly lower latency—crucial for responsive voice interfaces. It supports multiple languages and provides high-level APIs for transcription, speaker identification, and command recognition across platforms including Python, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and even Raspberry Pi.

The key advantage of Moonshine over OpenAI's Whisper is its optimization for live streaming and interactive voice applications. Unlike Whisper, which processes fixed 30-second audio windows and recomputes from scratch each time, Moonshine uses streaming models with caching to minimize latency and redundant computation. This makes it substantially faster on edge devices—for example, achieving 107ms latency on MacBook Pro compared to Whisper's 11+ seconds—while offering comparable or better accuracy and better multilingual support.

### Pi – A minimal terminal coding harness - (Hacker News)

https://pi.dev

# Summary

**Pi** is a minimal, extensible terminal coding agent designed to adapt to your workflow rather than forcing you into a predetermined one. It supports 15+ AI providers and hundreds of models, features tree-structured shareable sessions, and offers four integration modes (interactive, print/JSON, RPC, and SDK). The core philosophy emphasizes extensibility through TypeScript extensions, skills, prompt templates, and shareable npm packages—allowing users to build features like sub-agents, plan mode, and custom tools themselves rather than having them baked into the core.

The tool prioritizes context engineering with customizable system prompts, automatic message compaction, and dynamic context injection. It intentionally omits certain features (MCP, permission popups, built-in to-dos) that users can implement themselves as extensions or install from community packages, keeping the core lightweight while maximizing flexibility for different workflows and security requirements.

### Justifying Text-Wrap: Pretty - (Hacker News)

https://matklad.github.io/2026/02/14/justifying-text-wrap-pretty.html

# Summary

Safari became the first browser to ship a reasonable implementation of `text-wrap: pretty` in 2025, finally bringing 15th-century typographic principles to the web. The feature uses dynamic programming (a technique developed by Knuth and Plass for TeX in 1981) to intelligently break lines and balance paragraph width, rather than using the naive greedy algorithm that browsers had relied on for decades. While browsers face a harder problem than print designers due to variable and dynamic window widths, modern computing power makes this optimization feasible.

However, there's a bug when combining `text-wrap: pretty` with `text-align: justify`. The dynamic programming algorithm deliberately targets a slightly narrower line width to allow both overshooting and undershooting for better balance, but when justification stretches lines to the maximum width, this systematic overshoot creates disproportionately large spaces between words. The author requests that WebKit developers fix this interaction so that the feature can work as intended.
