## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1844248/deepfake-fraud-taking-place-on-an-industrial-scale-study-finds

# Summary

According to a new analysis by AI experts from the AI Incident Database, deepfake fraud has become an "industrial-scale" operation. Inexpensive and widely available AI tools now enable scammers to easily create personalized deepfake videos of public figures and authority figures for targeted fraud schemes. Recent examples include deepfake videos of Western Australia's premier promoting investment scams and fake doctors advertising skin creams, with one notable incident where a Singapore finance officer lost nearly $500,000 to scammers using a deepfake video call.

The analysis reveals that frauds and scams using AI have become the largest category of incidents reported to the database for 11 of the past 12 months. MIT researcher Simon Mylius notes that AI deepfake capabilities have become so accessible that "there is really effectively no barrier to entry," allowing virtually anyone to create convincing fake content for exploitation. This trend is particularly concerning given recent fraud losses, with UK consumers alone losing an estimated $12.86 billion to fraud between November 2024 and November 2025.

# Summary

A new study published in The Lancet Planetary Health found that increased adoption of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in California has measurably improved air quality. Using satellite data to track nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels between 2019 and 2023, researchers discovered that for every 200 EVs or plug-in hybrids added to the roads, NO2 levels dropped by 1.1%. This is significant because NO2 exposure can trigger asthma attacks, cause bronchitis, and increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.

The study demonstrates that as California—which has the largest number of plug-in vehicles in the United States—continues to electrify its vehicle fleet, the cumulative effect on air quality becomes substantial enough to have real public health benefits. While the article's comments section includes debate about tire particulate emissions from heavier EVs, the research confirms that the elimination of exhaust emissions from traditional vehicles provides a net positive effect on air pollution levels.

# Summary

A new NBER study finds that Kalshi, a federally regulated prediction market, produces macroeconomic forecasts that match or exceed those of professional forecasters and traditional financial instruments. Kalshi's modal forecast for the federal funds rate correctly predicted outcomes on the day before every FOMC meeting since 2022—something neither the Federal Reserve's Survey of Market Expectations nor fed funds futures achieved—and its median forecast for headline CPI showed statistically significant improvement over Bloomberg consensus.

Beyond matching traditional tools, Kalshi fills a unique market gap by providing real-time probability distributions for GDP growth, core CPI, unemployment, and payrolls that respond dynamically to macroeconomic news. The platform has grown substantially, with trading volumes reaching nearly 100 million contracts for single FOMC meetings, supported by major liquidity providers like Susquehanna, Citadel, and Two Sigma.

## https://linux.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/2034222/linux-70-kernel-confirmed-by-linus-torvalds-expected-in-mid-april-2026

# Summary

Linus Torvalds has confirmed that Linux 7.0 will be the next major kernel version, with release expected in mid-April 2026. The Linux 6.x era ended with kernel 6.19, and the merge window for Linux 7.0 opened on February 9th, 2026, with the first Release Candidate milestone expected on February 22nd.

The version bump to 7.0 is primarily a pragmatic numbering milestone rather than signaling massive breaking changes or revolutionary new features. Linux kernel versions historically don't follow strict semantic versioning; the major version increase was chosen to keep minor version numbers manageable, similar to how previous transitions (3.x to 4.x, 4.x to 5.x) were handled.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1929257/openai-starts-running-ads-in-chatgpt

# Summary

OpenAI has begun testing advertisements in ChatGPT for free and Go tier users in the United States, while keeping premium subscription tiers ad-free. The ads are targeted based on conversation topics and user history, clearly labeled as "sponsored," and OpenAI claims they don't influence ChatGPT's responses. The company restricts ads from sensitive topics like health and politics, excludes users under 18, and allows free users to opt out in exchange for reduced daily message limits.

The move has drawn significant criticism from Slashdot commenters, who view it as a sign of OpenAI's financial struggles and worry about the long-term implications of introducing advertisements to an AI assistant. Critics express concerns that despite current assurances, advertisers will eventually pressure OpenAI to influence content, censor topics, and further monetize user data—a pattern seen repeatedly with other technology platforms.

## https://developers.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1948212/sixteen-ai-agents-built-a-c-compiler-from-scratch

# Summary

Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini deployed 16 instances of Claude Opus 4.6 AI to collaboratively build a C compiler from scratch over two weeks, resulting in a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler that achieved a 99% pass rate on the GCC torture test suite. The compiler can build a bootable Linux kernel on multiple architectures and compile major open-source projects like PostgreSQL and Redis, though it has limitations including lack of a 16-bit x86 backend, buggy assembler/linker, and less efficient code generation than GCC. The project consumed nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions and $20,000 in API fees, with each AI agent independently claiming tasks through a shared Git repository, and required significant effort building test systems to keep agents productive.

## https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/181212/romance-publishing-has-an-ai-problem-and-most-readers-dont-know-it-yet

# Summary

The romance publishing industry is experiencing a significant problem with AI-generated content that most readers are unaware of. A Cape Town novelist published over 200 AI-assisted romance novels on Amazon last year, selling around 50,000 copies, while testing various AI tools like Claude, Grok, and NovelAI. The genre is particularly vulnerable to AI disruption because romance relies on familiar tropes and formulas, though current AI struggles with creating the slow-burn sexual tension that readers crave.

According to a BookBub survey, approximately one-third of authors are using generative AI for plotting, outlining, or writing, with most failing to disclose this to readers. Since romance accounts for over 20% of adult fiction print sales, the widespread adoption of undisclosed AI-generated content poses a genuine threat to the industry and raises transparency concerns for consumers who may unknowingly be purchasing machine-generated fiction rather than human-authored works.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1742213/autodesk-takes-google-to-court-over-ai-movie-software-named-flow

# Summary

Autodesk has filed a lawsuit against Google in San Francisco federal court, claiming Google infringed its "Flow" trademark by launching competing AI-powered software for movie, TV, and video game production in May 2025. Autodesk asserts it has used the Flow name since September 2022 and that Google had previously assured it would not commercialize a product under that same name.

According to the lawsuit, Google allegedly circumvented trademark protections by first filing a trademark application in Tonga (where filings are not publicly accessible) before later seeking U.S. trademark protection. The case highlights a dispute over naming rights for AI software tools in the creative industry, with questions about whether common words like "Flow" can be trademarked and what constitutes a legitimate competitive use versus trademark infringement.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1548222/google-lines-up-100-year-sterling-bond-sale

# Summary

Alphabet has announced plans to issue a rare 100-year sterling bond as part of a multi-currency debt offering that includes $15 billion in dollar bonds and a Swiss franc issuance. This move reflects Big Tech's aggressive borrowing to fund massive AI infrastructure investments, expected to total nearly $700 billion across the industry this year. Century bonds are highly unusual in the tech sector, with IBM's 1996 issuance being the last comparable example.

The announcement has sparked skepticism among observers and commentators, who view it as a potential sign of trouble rather than strength. Critics note that such extreme long-term borrowing may indicate desperation or lack of confidence in near-term AI profitability, while others draw comparisons to Motorola's century bond in 1997—issued just before the company's dramatic decline from tech dominance. However, supporters counter that as bonds have priority in liquidation and Alphabet's financial stability, the real motivation is likely to lock in current favorable interest rates before they potentially rise significantly in the future.

## https://yro.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/161215/discord-will-require-a-face-scan-or-id-for-full-access-next-month

# Summary

Discord is implementing mandatory age verification starting next month, requiring all users to verify their age through either facial recognition AI or government ID submission to maintain full platform access. Users who don't verify will be automatically switched to a "teen-appropriate" mode that restricts access to age-restricted servers and channels, filters graphic content, and limits livestream participation.

The company states that facial age estimation analysis occurs on users' devices and is never stored, while ID documents submitted to third-party vendors are deleted immediately after verification. However, the rollout has sparked privacy concerns among users and commenters, with many questioning the company's true motivations—ranging from legal liability mitigation and targeted advertising to data collection for government surveillance purposes.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1514248/ai-gold-rush-is-resurrecting-chinas-infamous-72-hour-work-week---in-us

# Summary

The AI industry boom has led US startups to adopt China's infamous "996" work schedule (9am-9pm, six days a week, roughly 70 hours), which China's own regulators previously cracked down on. Companies like Rilla and Browser-Use are openly advertising these grueling hours as a competitive advantage in the race to ship AI products. However, research contradicts this strategy: a WHO/ILO analysis linked 55+ hour work weeks to 745,000 deaths globally in 2016, and Michigan State University found that 70-hour workers produce nearly the same output as 50-hour workers.

The article's comments reveal debate about whether such hours are justifiable. Some argue that for young employees or early-stage startups offering significant compensation and equity upside, temporary intensive work periods could be worthwhile. Others contend the practice is fundamentally counterproductive, noting that productivity gains from overtime are temporary and diminish quickly as fatigue sets in, while the chances of striking it rich through startup stock options have significantly decreased compared to earlier tech booms.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/1413223/age-bias-is-still-the-default-at-work-but-the-data-is-turning

# Summary

Despite widespread age bias in the workplace, mounting research is making it increasingly difficult for companies to justify pushing out experienced workers. A 2025 study found that while processing speed declines with age, other critical capabilities like focus and accumulated knowledge continue improving, with peak overall functioning occurring between ages 55 and 60. Multiple studies demonstrate the business case for retaining older workers: AARP and OECD data show that a 10-percentage-point increase in workers over 50 correlates with roughly 1.1% higher productivity, cross-generational teams outperform homogeneous ones, and companies like B&Q and BMW saw significant productivity gains after hiring or retaining older workers.

However, the data-driven case for age diversity has yet to translate into widespread workplace practice. An Urban Institute analysis found that more than half of workers over 50 were pushed out of long-held jobs before they chose to retire between 1992 and 2016, suggesting that age bias remains the default corporate behavior despite mounting evidence of its inefficiency.

## https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/0644255/new-raspberry-pi-4-model-splits-ram-across-dual-chips

# Summary

Raspberry Pi has quietly introduced a new version of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (PCB 13a) that splits RAM across two chips instead of using a single RAM chip. The dual-chip configuration—with one LPDDR4 chip on top and another on the underside—was designed to improve supply chain flexibility and manufacturing efficiency by allowing the company to combine two smaller, cheaper modules to achieve the same total RAM capacity while managing fluctuating component costs.

This redesign has no impact on performance, as the Broadcom SoC still uses the same 32-bit memory interface and bandwidth. The new board remains fully compatible with existing accessories and software, though users will need to flash a new bootloader version. The change represents a practical manufacturing optimization rather than any functional improvement or degradation to the device.

## https://science.slashdot.org/story/26/02/09/0536231/spacex-prioritizes-lunar-self-growing-city-over-mars-project-musk-says

# Summary

Elon Musk announced that SpaceX is shifting its primary focus to building a "self-growing city" on the moon, which he claims could be achieved in less than 10 years, rather than continuing to prioritize Mars colonization. While SpaceX still plans to begin its long-held Mars city project within five to seven years, Musk stated that the moon is now the "overriding priority" for securing humanity's future. This marks a significant change from his previous stance, as he had previously aimed to send an uncrewed Mars mission by the end of 2026.

The announcement aligns with a Wall Street Journal report indicating that SpaceX has informed investors of the lunar prioritization, with a target of March 2027 for an uncrewed lunar landing. The shift represents a notable reversal of Musk's previous dismissal of lunar research as unnecessary, reflecting changing strategic priorities within the company.

## https://dev.to/the-foundation/i-built-federated-ai-knowledge-commons-heres-how-56oj

# Summary

Daniel Nwaneri built a decentralized knowledge-sharing platform in 21 days to address "knowledge collapse"—the problem of valuable technical insights disappearing into private AI chats while Stack Overflow's traffic plummets 78%. The system allows developers to save Claude conversations as HTML, import them with a single command, and make them searchable via semantic search. Critically, it includes an automated security scanner that detects and blocks sensitive data like API keys and credentials before sharing, ensuring safe knowledge preservation without leaking secrets.

The platform is built on edge-native infrastructure (Cloudflare Workers, D1 database, Vectorize embeddings) and implements ActivityPub federation, meaning it can connect with other instances in a decentralized network similar to Mastodon. Rather than relying on centralized platforms, developers can run their own instances and federate knowledge across the community. The project is open-source (MIT licensed) and production-ready, addressing the urgent need to rebuild a distributed, developer-owned knowledge commons before critical insights are permanently lost.

## https://dev.to/ujja/how-devto-became-my-comfortable-corner-of-the-internet-and-my-new-year-resolution-54h8

# Summary

The author shares their 10+ year journey away from mainstream social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter) toward finding community on dev.to, a platform that feels fundamentally different. They describe traditional social media as "loud" and comparison-driven, creating anxiety and inadequacy, whereas dev.to fosters genuine connection through honest technical discussions where people share both successes and failures without performative posturing.

Their New Year resolution is to be more actively engaged on dev.to while maintaining boundaries around their mental wellbeing. The author values dev.to as a rare "comfortable corner of the internet" where people show up as humans rather than brands, learning collectively rather than competitively. They emphasize that if the platform's authentic nature ever changes, they're prepared to step back—a reassuring reminder of their control over their digital presence.

## https://dev.to/googleai/how-fishjamio-built-a-multi-speaker-ai-game-using-gemini-live-20md

# Summary

Fishjam.io and Software Mansion built "Deep Sea Stories," a multi-speaker AI game using Google's Gemini Live API where players act as detectives questioning an AI "Riddle Master" about a mystery. The key challenge was handling group conversations—where people interrupt and talk simultaneously—which is far more complex than traditional one-on-one voice AI interactions. Traditional voice agent architectures process speech through a pipeline of speech-to-text, language model processing, and text-to-speech conversion, but Gemini Live's newer speech-to-speech approach reduces latency and preserves emotional nuances by processing audio directly.

The team evaluated three architectural approaches and ultimately selected server-side filtering using Voice Activity Detection (VAD) as their solution. This system acts as a "gatekeeper" that identifies when a player speaks, locks the input to that speaker, and forwards only their audio to the AI agent while ignoring simultaneous speech from others. The implementation uses Fishjam's WebRTC-based Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) to handle peer-to-peer audio streaming, with a backend agent that bridges player audio to the Gemini AI and relays responses back to all participants, effectively solving the complex problem of managing overlapping speech in group conversations.

## https://dev.to/helderberto/what-your-claude-code-agents-dont-need-to-be-told-4ed5

# Summary

This article argues that Claude Code agent configurations should prioritize project-specific knowledge over generic programming concepts. The author explains that since Claude already knows common patterns, design principles, and best practices, including them wastes valuable context tokens. Instead, configurations should focus on documenting project-specific gotchas, team conventions, and configuration quirks that the model cannot infer from code alone.

The article provides practical guidance for optimizing agent setup: use three filters (does the model already know this? is it repeated? is it a checklist or essay?), assign agents to judgment-based tasks and skills to deterministic commands, consolidate overlapping agents, add quality gates to workflows, and keep documentation concise. The core takeaway is that effective Claude Code configuration should contain only what the model doesn't already know, preserving context tokens for analyzing actual code.
