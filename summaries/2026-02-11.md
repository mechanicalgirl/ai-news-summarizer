# Summary

This humorous and practical blog post offers 23 lessons learned from living in a heavily snow-prone area, covering preparation and survival during winter storms. Key topics include power outages and backup systems (generators, wood stoves, batteries), snow removal techniques, proper winter clothing (waterproof pants, gaiters, layering), water storage for wells that require electricity, and maintaining supplies like firewood and shelf-stable food. The author emphasizes practical wisdom like reading equipment manuals, having neighbors with snowplows, and avoiding getting wet and cold.

The latter half shifts to morale and perspective, noting that winter confinement may not be as fulfilling as expected, while providing humorous comparisons to historical accounts of Alaskan survival. The final lessons address decision-making during extended power outages—specifically, recognizing when conditions have become untenable and evacuating rather than exhausting yourself trying to manage the crisis alone. Throughout, the post blends practical preparedness advice with witty observations about the psychological and physical challenges of snowy climates.

# Summary

Jeff Geerling and his father toured a modern SMPTE 2110 broadcast truck used for St. Louis Blues hockey games to explore the technology and teamwork behind live sports broadcasting. The experience revealed the critical role of precise timing infrastructure—specifically Evertz grandmaster clocks and PTP (Precision Timing Protocol)—which synchronize all digital video, audio, and metadata across the truck's IP network. The engineer manually sets the clocks using an atomic clock app rather than GPS, since mobile trucks can't always guarantee clear sky access.

Beyond the technical systems, Geerling was most impressed by the professional team operating the equipment, including camera operators, audio engineers, and replay specialists who work together seamlessly through constant structured communication to deliver broadcasts multiple times per month. The facility itself showcases hybrid analog-digital infrastructure, with hundreds of XLR audio connections and newer SMPTE connectors that carry both data and power, demonstrating how modern broadcast has transitioned from pure analog to complex integrated IP networks while maintaining reliability.

# Summary

This article argues that the technological singularity—when AI advancement accelerates beyond human comprehension—will occur on a specific date in 2034. The author analyzes five metrics of AI progress (MMLU scores, cost per token, release intervals, arXiv papers on emergence, and AI code generation) using hyperbolic curve fitting rather than exponential models. Only one metric—the count of AI papers about "emergence"—shows genuine hyperbolic curvature pointing toward a finite singularity date, suggesting the mathematical model identifies a real inflection point.

However, the author makes a provocative claim: the actual capability metrics (MMLU, tokens per dollar, release intervals) show linear growth with no singularity signal. Instead, human *attention* and *perception* of AI breakthroughs are accelerating hyperbolically. This reframes the singularity not as machines becoming infinitely capable, but as humans losing the ability to process AI surprises faster than they occur. The author argues this "social singularity" is already underway, evidenced by anticipatory job displacement, regulatory lag, and collapsing institutional trust—suggesting the real danger isn't superintelligent AI, but society's destabilization in response to *perceived* AI progress.
