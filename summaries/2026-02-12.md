# Summary

Apple has delayed its long-promised Siri AI overhaul once again due to technical difficulties discovered during internal testing. The new Siri, originally announced in June 2024 and expected by early 2025, struggles with reliability issues including unreliable query processing, slow response times, and an over-reliance on OpenAI's ChatGPT rather than Apple's own technology. As a result, several key features have been pushed from the March iOS 26.4 update to later releases.

The rollout will now occur in stages, with new Siri capabilities being tested in iOS 26.5 (May 2026) with a "preview" toggle for personal data features, while a more ambitious chatbot-style version called "Campo"—powered by Google servers and a custom Gemini model—is being developed for iOS 27 in September 2026.

# Summary

A safety researcher named Mrinank Sharma has quit Anthropic, the AI safety-focused company, warning that "the world is in peril" due to AI advances. Sharma cited concerns that the safety team faces constant pressure to deprioritize critical safety issues, including risks related to bioterrorism. This departure adds to a broader trend of AI safety researchers leaving major tech companies over concerns about catastrophic risks, and aligns with statements from Anthropic's own CEO, Dario Amodei, who has publicly called for regulation to slow down AI progress.

The article highlights growing tension between commercial AI development pressures and genuine safety concerns within the industry, with experts increasingly leaving their positions when they feel their safety recommendations are being sidelined.

# Summary

Amazon-owned Ring has created a widespread surveillance network through its doorbell cameras and outdoor security devices, which the company is now leveraging with new AI features and police partnerships. Ring's latest "Search Party" feature—promoted during the Super Bowl as a tool to find missing pets—exemplifies how the company obscures the dystopian reality of its surveillance capabilities. Under returning founder Jamie Siminoff, Ring is expanding police partnerships, integrating with law enforcement surveillance firm Flock, and introducing features like "Familiar Faces" that identify known individuals, creating what critics describe as a consumer-deployed surveillance dragnet with concerning implications for privacy.

Critics argue that Ring has established "cozy relationships with law enforcement" and that the cheerful marketing of pet-finding features masks the serious privacy and civil liberties issues inherent in a networked surveillance system accessible to authorities. The initiative raises questions about how footage can be misused beyond its intended purpose and whether consumers adequately understand the surveillance infrastructure they're building by adopting Ring products.

## https://linux.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1821222/is-linux-mint-burning-out-developers-consider-longer-release-cycle

# Summary

Linux Mint developers are considering extending their development cycle beyond the current six-month release schedule, citing the burden that constant releases place on their small team. The developers argue that their existing rapid release cadence, combined with LMDE releases, consumes significant resources in testing, fixing, and shipping updates, leaving limited capacity for more substantial development work. While the current process delivers steady improvements, the team wants to free up bandwidth to focus on deeper technical work rather than perpetual release management.

The potential shift toward longer development cycles represents a notable departure from Linux Mint's traditionally consistent release rhythm. The team plans to base their next release on a new Ubuntu LTS and is seriously exploring a more extended development window, though it remains unclear whether this signals major technical changes ahead or simply reflects the realistic bandwidth constraints of a small development team trying to maintain one of desktop Linux's most popular and reliable distributions.

## https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1814253/a-hellish-hothouse-earth-getting-closer-scientists-say

# Summary

Scientists warn that the world is dangerously close to irreversible climate tipping points that could trigger a cascade of feedback loops, locking Earth into a catastrophic "hothouse" climate far worse than the currently projected 2-3°C warming. At the current 1.3°C of heating, extreme weather is already devastating lives globally, but researchers emphasize that a hothouse Earth scenario would be even more severe and fundamentally incompatible with human civilization as we know it.

The international team of climate scientists, including researchers from the Potsdam Institute and other leading institutions, is issuing this urgent warning because once these tipping points are crossed, the climate shift may become irreversible even if fossil fuel emissions are eventually cut. They stress that while rapid emission reductions are challenging, the difficulty of reversing course afterward makes immediate precautionary action essential, as the timing of these tipping points remains unpredictable.

## https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1754240/us-had-almost-no-job-growth-in-2025

# Summary

The U.S. economy added only 181,000 jobs throughout all of 2025, a dramatic revision downward from the initially reported 584,000 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This represents a sharp decline compared to the 1.46 million jobs added in 2024 and indicates near-zero job growth for the year. However, there is a positive sign for 2026, as January saw hiring increase by 130,000 roles—significantly exceeding economist expectations of 55,000—with gains concentrated in healthcare, social assistance, and construction sectors.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/176205/evs-could-be-cheaper-to-own-than-gas-cars-in-africa-by-2040

# Summary

A new study from ETH Zurich suggests that electric vehicles paired with solar off-grid charging systems could become cheaper to own than gas-powered cars across most of Africa by 2040, despite EVs currently accounting for only 1% of new car sales on the continent. The analysis considers total cost of ownership including purchase price, financing, and fuel/charging costs, and projects that electric two-wheelers could reach cost parity even sooner, by the end of this decade.

The primary barrier to EV adoption in Africa is financing, as high borrowing costs in many countries can make loan interest exceed the vehicle's purchase price. However, countries like South Africa, Mauritius, and Botswana already have financing conditions close to achieving cost parity, while others would need significant reductions in borrowing costs to make EVs economically competitive with traditional vehicles.

## https://news.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1656216/uk-orders-deletion-of-countrys-largest-court-reporting-archive

# Summary

The UK's Ministry of Justice has ordered the deletion of Courtsdesk's court reporting archive, the country's largest database of court records that over 1,500 journalists across 39 media organizations have relied on since 2021. The government cited "unauthorized sharing" of court data based on a test feature, though Courtsdesk claims it properly contracted with a company under strict data usage restrictions and notified the Ministry accordingly. The company requested dialogue 16 times and asked for an investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office, which was denied.

This deletion is particularly controversial given that Courtsdesk's research revealed significant failures in the UK court system, including 1.6 million criminal hearings without journalist notice, court listings accurate only 4.2% of the time, and half a million weekend cases heard without press notification. The forced deletion threatens judicial transparency and press freedom, with even the former justice minister who originally approved the project now demanding the decision be reversed.

## https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1640236/are-cds-making-a-comeback-a-statistical-analysis

# Summary

According to a statistical analysis, reports of the CD's death may be overstated. While CD revenue share in the U.S. music industry plummeted from 7.15% in 2018 to 3.04% in 2022, it has stabilized at around 3% since then (3.14% in 2023 and 3.06% in 2024). Additionally, Google search traffic for "CD Player" has increased over the past 16 months after two decades of decline, and a 2023 YouGov poll found that 53% of American adults would be willing to buy music on CDs.

However, the potential comeback appears limited by supply-side constraints. Despite consumer interest, artists have not meaningfully shifted back toward CD production, with vinyl remaining the dominant format for new physical releases. The data suggests a stabilization rather than a true resurgence, with younger consumers showing more interest in physical formats than older demographics, but without corresponding production increases to meet potential demand.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1549234/hp-now-rents-gaming-laptops

# Summary

HP has launched the OMEN Gaming Subscription service, which allows customers to rent gaming laptops monthly (ranging from $50-$130) rather than own them. However, the economics are unfavorable: subscribers exceed the laptop's retail price within 16-25 months without ever gaining ownership. While the service includes yearly hardware upgrades, next-day replacements, and 24/7 support, steep early termination fees ($550-$1,430) lock users into contracts for at least 13 months.

User comments on Slashdot criticize the offering as a poor financial deal, comparing it to predatory rent-to-own schemes that exploit consumers. Most agree that even financing a laptop purchase at high interest rates would be more economical, and buyers could resell old hardware to offset costs. The consensus is that this is effectively a lease disguised as a subscription, with no path to ownership despite long-term payments.

## https://slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1431206/sony-will-ship-its-final-blu-ray-recorders-this-month

# Summary

Sony is discontinuing its Blu-ray recorder business, with the final shipments occurring this month. These recorders were primarily sold in Japan for time-shifting broadcast television. The company had already halted manufacturing of both the devices and recordable discs about a year ago, with this final shipment clearing out remaining inventory.

The decline is attributed to the rise of streaming services, which have made physical media recording obsolete. While Blu-ray recorders are ending, the broader format survives through other manufacturers—Asus, LG, and Pioneer continue producing PC drives, and Panasonic and Verbatim still manufacture Blu-ray media. Sony will continue selling Blu-ray players for now. The format itself, which debuted in 2006, is now 20 years old.

## https://tech.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/141215/t-mobile-will-live-translate-regular-phone-calls-without-an-app

# Summary

T-Mobile is launching a beta test for Live Translation, an AI-powered feature that will translate phone calls in real-time into over 50 languages when it debuts this spring. The service operates at the network level rather than requiring a specific app, allowing users to simply dial 87 to activate translation on any call. It works across VoLTE, VoNR, and VoWiFi connections, and the beta will be free, though pricing for the full launch hasn't been determined.

The announcement has raised significant concerns among commenters about privacy, consent, and liability. Key issues include whether the network-level processing constitutes recording, what happens when AI mistranslations cause real-world problems or misunderstandings, and the legal implications of T-Mobile monitoring calls. Critics also worry about accountability disclaimers that would likely shield T-Mobile from responsibility for translation errors, particularly when idiomatic phrases or sarcasm are mistranslated in potentially serious ways.

## https://science.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/1219230/moderna-says-fda-refuses-to-review-its-application-for-experimental-flu-shot

# Summary

Moderna announced that the FDA has refused to review its application for an experimental flu shot (mRNA-1010), marking another instance of the Trump administration's influence on vaccine regulation in the U.S. The company stated that the FDA's rejection is inconsistent with prior feedback and that the agency cited study design concerns rather than any safety or efficacy issues, despite previously approving the same design. Moderna's flu shot had shown positive Phase 3 trial results and was intended as a standalone vaccine and component of a combination influenza-COVID vaccine.

The FDA's decision not to review the application is viewed as part of a broader shift in vaccine policy under the Trump administration. Moderna indicated it plans to request a meeting with the FDA to understand the path forward, though the company stated the rejection won't impact its 2026 financial guidance. The development has sparked concerns among observers about anti-vaccine attitudes influencing government policy and potentially impeding vaccine development and public health efforts.

## https://yro.slashdot.org/story/26/02/11/0722256/discord-tries-to-walk-back-age-verification-panic-says-most-users-wont-need-face-scans

# Summary

Discord has attempted to address user concerns about its upcoming age verification mandate by clarifying that most users won't need to submit face scans or government IDs. Instead, the platform will use an internal "age prediction" model based on account information, device data, and behavioral patterns to estimate users' ages. Only those whose age cannot be confidently determined will be required to submit video selfies or IDs.

The clarification came after significant backlash, including threats from users to leave the platform and cancel subscriptions, as well as a prior data breach by a third-party age verification vendor that exposed user information and ID cards. Users identified as under 18 will be placed in a restricted "teen-appropriate" experience that limits access to age-restricted servers and channels.

## https://dev.to/sylwia-lask/how-seriously-should-we-take-state-of-js-and-other-developer-surveys-9ce

# Summary

Developer surveys like State of JS are valuable but shouldn't be treated as absolute truth. While they effectively capture trends and sentiment within the developer community—showing that TypeScript is mainstream, major frameworks hold their positions, and tooling continues evolving—they have significant limitations. The surveys primarily reflect the opinions of engaged, tech-savvy developers who actively follow trends and participate in online communities, missing the perspective of developers who treat programming as a regular job. Additionally, these surveys lack the rigorous scientific methodology of academic research and don't account for regional variations in technology adoption or the gap between what's popular in surveys versus what dominates actual job markets.

The author recommends treating surveys as a compass rather than a GPS—useful for understanding community direction and emerging trends, but not as definitive guidance for career or technology decisions. Real-world factors like team expertise, legacy codebases, and hiring practicality often override survey results. Instead of obsessing over what ranks highest in satisfaction, developers should focus on year-to-year movement patterns, compare usage against satisfaction metrics, and remember that popular tools receive more criticism simply because they're widely used in production environments.

## https://dev.to/richardpascoe/stack-overflow-time-for-a-change-c2p

# Summary

Stack Overflow, once the go-to resource for developers seeking coding solutions, faces declining engagement as developers increasingly turn to friendlier alternative communities like DEV and Hashnode, as well as AI tools like ChatGPT. The article argues that Stack Overflow missed opportunities to evolve by maintaining rigid Q&A formats and strict moderation rather than experimenting with more conversational, beginner-friendly approaches that reward human expertise alongside AI assistance.

The author poses a key question: rather than replacing Stack Overflow entirely, should the developer community embrace a diverse ecosystem of Q&A platforms and communities that each feel "alive" and welcoming? This approach would allow different communities to experiment with moderation styles and culture while maintaining the knowledge and expertise that makes developer resources valuable.

## https://dev.to/the_nortern_dev/your-read-later-list-is-a-graveyard-it-is-time-to-stop-hoarding-388g

**Summary:**

Many people suffer from the "Collector's Fallacy"—accumulating thousands of unread articles, tabs, and bookmarks while mistakenly believing that saving content equals learning. The author argues that traditional "Read Later" apps like Instapaper and Notion are designed to encourage hoarding rather than actual knowledge acquisition, exploiting users' need to feel productive. To combat this, the author developed Sigilla, a privacy-focused reading app that uses spaced repetition (similar to Anki flashcards) to resurface saved articles and force users to actively engage with content or delete it, rather than letting it languish indefinitely.

The key difference in Sigilla's approach is that it prioritizes forced engagement over passive accumulation, and privacy over data collection. Rather than tracking user behavior for ad targeting, the app only calculates reading metrics locally in the browser. The author's core philosophy is that knowledge workers need tools that respect their attention and compel them to actually read and learn, not tools that profit from their distraction and digital hoarding habits.

## https://dev.to/itsugo/one-month-at-a-startup-what-stayed-with-me-after-i-left-42an

# Summary

The author describes their one-month experience at an early-stage startup where initial excitement quickly gave way to dysfunction. While the fast-paced environment initially appealed to them, they encountered serious problems: unstable code, lack of clear ownership, shifting requirements, and a toxic dynamic where they were held responsible without being trusted with real authority. Physical warning signs—constant dread, nausea, sleep issues, and anxiety—signaled they had crossed from being challenged into survival mode.

The author ultimately left not due to inability to handle pressure, but because the environment lacked the structure, clarity, and respect necessary for genuine growth. Despite the short tenure, they gained valuable lessons about the importance of systems, ownership, and boundaries in any organization. Having secured alternative opportunities beforehand, they departed with clarity rather than desperation, understanding that bad systems can erode capable people's confidence while good ones build it up.

## https://dev.to/ujja/how-devto-became-my-comfortable-corner-of-the-internet-and-my-new-year-resolution-54h8

# Summary

The author reflects on their decade-long absence from mainstream social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, finding peace in the absence of constant comparison and noise. After discovering dev.to six years ago through a friend's recommendation, they found it to be a refreshing alternative—a space that feels like a genuine community rather than a highlight reel, where people openly share both successes and failures without the pressure to perform or compete.

For their New Year's resolution, the author committed to becoming more actively engaged on dev.to while remaining mindful of their mental well-being. They appreciate the platform's unique culture of honest, collective learning where people show up as authentic humans rather than polished brands, and value it as one of the rare corners of the internet that has maintained genuine community spirit without the anxiety-inducing comparison typical of other social networks.
