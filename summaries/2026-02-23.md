# Summary

Joel Hawksley developed Timeframe, a family e-paper dashboard system that displays calendar, weather, and smart home data in his home. Starting with a Magic Mirror prototype over a decade ago, he experimented with jailbroken Kindles before settling on Visionect e-paper displays, which proved reliable and unobtrusive. After his home was destroyed in the 2021 Marshall Fire, he redesigned the system around the new Boox Mira Pro 25.3" display, which offered real-time updates and higher resolution, allowing him to add features like current music playback and precipitation forecasts.

The project's backend evolved significantly to support real-time functionality, with Joel migrating toward Home Assistant as the primary data source to reduce complexity. Today, Timeframe intelligently displays only relevant status information (like open doors or completed laundry) in a small corner indicator, following a philosophy that a blank status means the house is functioning normally. While the system works excellently for his family, challenges remain in hardening it for broader deployment, including reducing hardware costs (currently around $2000) and fully integrating Home Assistant before bringing it to market.

# Summary

The JavaScript Oxidation Compiler (Oxc) is a collection of high-performance JavaScript development tools written in Rust, designed to replace traditional JavaScript tooling with significantly faster alternatives. It includes Oxlint (an ESLint-compatible linter that's 50-100x faster), Oxfmt (a Prettier-compatible formatter 35x faster than the original), a parser 3x faster than SWC, and tools for transforming, resolving modules, and minifying code. All components are free and open source, with support for modern JavaScript/TypeScript features and type-aware linting.

The project positions itself as the foundation for modern JavaScript tooling, offering dramatic performance improvements across the development workflow while maintaining compatibility with existing ESLint and Prettier ecosystems. It's backed by various sponsors and contributors, making it a community-driven effort to modernize JavaScript development infrastructure.

# Summary

0 A.D. Release 28: "Boiorix" is a free, open-source real-time strategy game of ancient warfare developed by Wildfire Games. This marks the first release without an "Alpha" label, signifying the project's maturity. The game is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS under GPL v2 and Creative Commons licenses, with no paywalls, ads, or in-game purchases.

The release introduces a new Germanic faction (Cimbri and allied tribes) as a playable civilization with unique economic flexibility through supply wagons and wagon encampments, alongside historical Roman opponents. Major features include gendered civilian units for improved historical accuracy, direct font rendering that enables better support for East Asian languages and high-resolution displays, expanded game setup options, improved multiplayer lobbying with enhanced security, and various engine upgrades including a 64-bit Windows build and upgraded JavaScript support. The developers are actively seeking contributors in video editing, social media, web design, testing, translation, and development.

# Loops Summary

Loops is an open-source, federated alternative to mainstream short-video platforms like TikTok, designed to give creators control over their content and communities. Built on ActivityPub technology, it allows videos to be shared across the fediverse while eliminating corporate lock-in, invasive ads, and data mining. The platform offers creator-friendly tools including a minimal camera interface, chronological feeds, threaded comments, and hashtag-based discovery, all without manipulative engagement algorithms.

Founded on the principle that social media should serve people rather than exploit them, Loops prioritizes user privacy, ethical design, and community governance over profit. Currently in open beta, it's available as both a web platform and mobile app, and emphasizes sustainability and transparency while remaining ad-free through community sponsorships and donations.

Hacker News

# Summary

This article explores an abandoned technological timeline where microwave ovens replaced stovetops as the primary cooking method, using Marie T. Smith's 1985 cookbook *Microwave Cooking for One* as a guide. The author explains that when the cookbook was published, microwave adoption was still rising and seemed like an inevitable replacement for traditional cooking—particularly as women entered the workforce. Smith was a "microwave maximalist" who spent a decade perfecting techniques to cook virtually anything in a microwave, challenging the modern perception of microwaves as merely reheating devices.

The article details how microwave cooking actually works and explores Smith's forgotten techniques, including the use of specialized cookware like pyroceram browning skillets—which could reach the high temperatures needed for the Maillard reaction (browning). The author discovers that while some techniques work well, the microwave future ultimately lost to traditional stove-top cooking and non-stick Teflon pans, representing a technological path not taken. The piece uses this culinary exploration as a lens to examine how certain innovations fail to achieve dominance despite initial promise, leaving behind only obscure artifacts and cookbooks as traces of their alternate timeline.

# Summary

Researchers at RiSE MSR developed the **a3 framework** to automatically generate Advanced Automated Analysis engines, creating a3-python as a Python program verifier. Rather than hand-crafting a verifier, they used AI agents to discover mathematical foundations (based on Hilbert's theorems and barrier certificates) and generate verification tools that are both theoretically grounded and practically applicable. When tested on the popular "requests" Python library, a3-python analyzed 183 functions and identified 4 genuine bugs while proving 179 potential issues safe, demonstrating the feasibility of AI-assisted verification for complex, real-world codebases.

The development process combined AI-driven theoretical discovery with iterative refinement: starting with ambitious mathematical concepts around quantitative model checking, the team pivoted to barrier certificate synthesis—a more mainstream symbolic verification approach—and then used structured prompts and automated loops to implement the system. This agentic workflow seamlessly transitioned from high-level mathematical theory through coding and testing phases, creating a verifier that handles Python's complexity and discovers bugs that typically escape code reviews and testing.

Hacker News

# Summary

Multiple Google AI Ultra and Pro subscribers report their accounts have been suddenly restricted without warning after using third-party integrations like OpenClaw with Gemini models. Users experienced 403 errors and complete account lockouts, with Google support providing no advance notification, slow response times, or clear explanations. While one user eventually received a response stating the suspension was due to violating Terms of Service by using credentials with third-party tools, Google maintained a zero-tolerance policy and refused to restore access.

The situation has escalated into a widespread issue affecting numerous paying customers ($249+/month subscriptions). Users report being caught in circular support loops between different Google departments, deleted acknowledgment posts on forums, and account bans for asking questions. Despite initial promises of investigation from Google representatives, the company has failed to provide timely communication or solutions, prompting many subscribers to cancel their services and migrate to competitors like Claude or Codex.
